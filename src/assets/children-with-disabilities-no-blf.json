The charity was first established in January 2003 under the name of the Holly & Chloe School of Dance and had the objects of giving relief, education and a leisure activity to local children with disabilities by the provision of therapeutic and educational exercises through the medium of dance. These aims were later changed to encompass adult services, and the name of the charity was also changed in August 2011 when Dramatize Charity Trust was established. However, two of the Trustees who established the original charity have remained engaged. The CIC was established in October 2012 in order to operate the Theatrical Day Service from Ashford Pavilion in Ashford Park. Although the primary focus is adults (18+) with disabilities, Dramarize also offers a range of workshops for young people, as it wishes to be all encompassing in its goal of bringing empowerment to its service users by enabling them to develop professionally and personally. Dramatize works with individuals with learning disabilities ranging from mild to profound. A range of activities are provided which will broaden students' knowledge and provide a form of respite for parents/carers. The Dramatize club offers offer a safe, supportive, and secure environment in which individuals enjoy a range of activities including drama, arts, sports and community outings.

Prior to that, we operated under the name K.E.E.N (Kid's Enjoy Exercise Now), registered charity number 299786. Since this transition, our provision to our disabled service users has remained unchanged. KEEN provides free sporting and social activities for children and young adults with wide ranging needs and disabilities. We aim to provide one-to-one support to our service users (our \"Athletes\") from dedicated volunteers (our \"Coaches\"), who are largely students from Oxford's two universities. We run four different sessions, which take place each week of Oxford University term time. These include a multi-sports club for ages 4 - 25 (called AllSorts), two social clubs for teenagers and adults respectively (KEEN teens and GrEAT) as well as a creative session aimed at primary school age children (Zig-Zag). In additional to these, KEEN runs various one-off holiday activities, known as \"KEEN+\", which include swimming, pantomime visits, day-trips and more. KEEN gives disabled young people from Oxfordshire the opportunity to take part in a variety of activities that are similar to those enjoyed by their able bodied peers, yet may otherwise be unavailable to them. Our high level of support means that we can cater to a wide range of needs and disabilities, and tailor activities such that everyone can get involved.

Many of the children have experienced trauma, bereavement, family breakdown, bullying, or have emerging mental health issues. These experiences/ disorders lead to emotional and behavioural difficulties, such as self-harm, substance abuse, risk-taking, truancy, anxiety, depression, aggression or withdrawal. As a result, young people struggle to engage with their education, families and communities; which in turn prevents them reaching their full potential. Without support, issues continue to disrupt children\u2019s education and risk escalating and continuing into adulthood. Kids Inspire create bespoke packages of support tailored to individual needs. Where it will benefit the child, we also support their parents and siblings. Services include the following: * Individual Therapy: including clinically proven counselling, Arts Psychotherapy, complementary therapies and talking therapy. *Group Work: including Lunch Club, Youth Forum, Dramatherapy and Filmmaking. *Mentoring: support and guidance on a one-to-one basis, provided by trained volunteers. *Coaching: supporting disadvantaged young people to improve their emotional health and mental wellbeing. Referrals come from local GPs, Primary/ Secondary/ Special Schools, EWMHS, Social Services, paediatricians, Health Visitors, Family Solutions teams, third sector agencies, and self-referrals. Kids Inspire empowers children and young people to make sense of their experiences and feelings to improve their emotional wellbeing. We achieve this by supporting service users to develop the knowledge and tools required to build resilience and coping mechanisms; enabling them to manage independently long-term.

, {"recipientOrganization": [{"charityNumber": "1170940", "companyNumber": "10348139", "description": "Home-Start Essex (HSE) is a leading family support charity based in Essex working to achieve healthy and positive outcomes for children and families. Our work comprises a long-established volunteer home visiting service, offering emotional and practical help to families experiencing difficulties, alongside a range of family groups, well-being programmes, courses and events. What makes our charity special, is that all our trained volunteers have lived experience as parents/carers themselves. We believe in the power of community mobilisation, and so invest in local areas to support local families. Our Vision is: \u2018For every child and young person in Essex to grow up in a family that is strong, resilient and able to access the support they need; when and where they need it\u2019 HSE recognises that bringing up children can be hard work. All parents and carers will, from time to time, encounter problems which make the task harder. The key to success is for parents and carers to be strong and resilient, so they can meet challenges head on, and navigate their way through or around them successfully. Through mobilising hundreds of volunteers, we support families to help themselves, developing parenting skills and improving connections in their community. Our volunteers support families struggling with: \u2022 Mental Health issues (including peri/post-natal depression, etc.) \u2022 Financial hardship \u2022 Physical health issues \u2022 Single parenthood \u2022 Low self-esteem and confidence \u2022 Domestic abuse \u2022 Isolation \u2022 Routines and boundaries \u2022 Bereavement and other significant life events The main activities of HSE are as follows: \u2022 Home-Visiting service, led by volunteers \u2022 Family Groups \u2022 School Readiness programme (e.g. Big Hopes-Big Futures) \u2022 Peri/post-natal support groups \u2022 Targeted mental health and wellbeing programmes \u2022 Counselling \u2022 Volunteer training and recruitment \u2022 Information, Advice, Guidance (IAG) and signposting \u2022 Food Bank Voucher distribution \u2022 Family activity days Our main funders are The Big Lottery Fund, BBC Children in Need, Virgin/Banardo\u2019s PB-19yrs Contract, Essex Community Foundation, Clinical Commissioning Groups and local trusts. A new 5-Year Strategic Plan will be launched in March 2018 which will see HSE developing its funding streams to be more diverse; allowing the organisation to grow and build on excellent practice. Since April 2017, HSE has supported 368 families and 755 children, with over 200 trained volunteers offering 1,834 home visits, totalling 3,006 hours\u2019 time across Essex. 95% of all frontline delivery continues to be entirely volunteer led. It is currently estimated that over the course of one year, the value of HSE volunteer time will be over \u00a372,000 (ONS figures https://goo.gl/Uwz2cz). HSE measures impact across 14 individual areas of need (e.g. isolation, mental health, family conflict, etc.) with over 80% of families showing significant positive change. \u201cMy volunteer made a huge difference. Someone who\u2019s not going to judge and always took the time to stop and listen\u201d. We know that our model allows us to engage with those who would otherwise be considered \u2018hard to reach\u2019. Families frequently tell us the impact of a volunteer, giving their time freely, can be far more meaningful than a paid statutory professional. Isolation and mental health issues remain the top two concerns for most of the families we support, and this often means their ability to access mainstream services is limited. This provides HSE a unique opportunity to implement our proposed PICoD Project (Preventative IAG Co-Design) project; a three-year co-produced, family-led process that will develop a new model of information, advice and guidance (IAG). This will be aimed at those predominantly in the peri/post-natal period; a key period for those at risk of poor mental health and well-being. As an existing provider of peri/postnatal services in Harlow, and with a strong history of peer/ volunteer led practice, HSE are ideally positioned to lead on the project; building on our expertise and ability to engage families; ensuring that their voice is not only heard, but responded to in practical, real terms. HSE are confident that the project is deliverable as commitment has been tested with partners (e.g. Virgin/Banardo\u2019s and University of Essex (UofE)) who say objectives are both realistic and achievable. By drawing on our existing network of partners, and engagement with families, HSE are keen to shape the future of family led practice. We believe this is achievable by harnessing the voices and opinions of service users as a tool; to shape and influence the way in which future information, advice and service delivery is commissioned. At HSE, our approach to project design, development and delivery is thorough and systematic. At concept stage, HSE appoints a Project Lead and a Project Delivery Team to draft delivery plans (in a standard format) and undertake initial research. This involves liaising with stakeholders (staff, service users, potential funders and partners, etc.); testing project feasibility; identifying resource needs; establishing project milestones/dependencies/budgets; and undertaking SWOT analysis.

Our work comprises a long-established volunteer home visiting service, offering emotional and practical help to families experiencing difficulties, alongside a range of family groups, well-being programmes, courses and events. What makes our charity special, is that all our trained volunteers have lived experience as parents/carers themselves. We believe in the power of community mobilisation, and so invest in local areas to support local families. Our Vision is: \u2018For every child and young person in Essex to grow up in a family that is strong, resilient and able to access the support they need; when and where they need it\u2019 HSE recognises that bringing up children can be hard work. All parents and carers will, from time to time, encounter problems which make the task harder. The key to success is for parents and carers to be strong and resilient, so they can meet challenges head on, and navigate their way through or around them successfully. Through mobilising hundreds of volunteers, we support families to help themselves, developing parenting skills and improving connections in their community. Our volunteers support families struggling with: \u2022 Mental Health issues (including peri/post-natal depression, etc.) \u2022 Financial hardship \u2022 Physical health issues \u2022 Single parenthood \u2022 Low self-esteem and confidence \u2022 Domestic abuse \u2022 Isolation \u2022 Routines and boundaries \u2022 Bereavement and other significant life events The main activities of HSE are as follows: \u2022 Home-Visiting service, led by volunteers \u2022 Family Groups \u2022 School Readiness programme (e.g. Big Hopes-Big Futures) \u2022 Peri/post-natal support groups \u2022 Targeted mental health and wellbeing programmes \u2022 Counselling \u2022 Volunteer training and recruitment \u2022 Information, Advice, Guidance (IAG) and signposting \u2022 Food Bank Voucher distribution \u2022 Family activity days Our main funders are The Big Lottery Fund, BBC Children in Need, Virgin/Banardo\u2019s PB-19yrs Contract, Essex Community Foundation, Clinical Commissioning Groups and local trusts. A new 5-Year Strategic Plan will be launched in March 2018 which will see HSE developing its funding streams to be more diverse; allowing the organisation to grow and build on excellent practice. Since April 2017, HSE has supported 368 families and 755 children, with over 200 trained volunteers offering 1,834 home visits, totalling 3,006 hours\u2019 time across Essex. 95% of all frontline delivery continues to be entirely volunteer led. It is currently estimated that over the course of one year, the value of HSE volunteer time will be over \u00a372,000 (ONS figures https://goo.gl/Uwz2cz). HSE measures impact across 14 individual areas of need (e.g. isolation, mental health, family conflict, etc.) with over 80% of families showing significant positive change. \u201cMy volunteer made a huge difference. Someone who\u2019s not going to judge and always took the time to stop and listen\u201d. We know that our model allows us to engage with those who would otherwise be considered \u2018hard to reach\u2019. Families frequently tell us the impact of a volunteer, giving their time freely, can be far more meaningful than a paid statutory professional. Isolation and mental health issues remain the top two concerns for most of the families we support, and this often means their ability to access mainstream services is limited. This provides HSE a unique opportunity to implement our proposed PICoD Project (Preventative IAG Co-Design) project; a three-year co-produced, family-led process that will develop a new model of information, advice and guidance (IAG). This will be aimed at those predominantly in the peri/post-natal period; a key period for those at risk of poor mental health and well-being. As an existing provider of peri/postnatal services in Harlow, and with a strong history of peer/ volunteer led practice, HSE are ideally positioned to lead on the project; building on our expertise and ability to engage families; ensuring that their voice is not only heard, but responded to in practical, real terms. HSE are confident that the project is deliverable as commitment has been tested with partners (e.g. Virgin/Banardo\u2019s and University of Essex (UofE)) who say objectives are both realistic and achievable. By drawing on our existing network of partners, and engagement with families, HSE are keen to shape the future of family led practice. We believe this is achievable by harnessing the voices and opinions of service users as a tool; to shape and influence the way in which future information, advice and service delivery is commissioned. At HSE, our approach to project design, development and delivery is thorough and systematic. At concept stage, HSE appoints a Project Lead and a Project Delivery Team to draft delivery plans (in a standard format) and undertake initial research. This involves liaising with stakeholders (staff, service users, potential funders and partners, etc.); testing project feasibility; identifying resource needs; establishing project milestones/dependencies/budgets; and undertaking SWOT analysis.

What we do: \u2022 Help boys through male-led group mentoring, to cope with problems and issues faced at home and school, and explore the important choices they face in their adolescent development, to prevent escalation of negative behaviour. \u2022 Provide boys with opportunities for adventure, to be tested and challenged, both physically and mentally. \u2022 Provide boys with practical life-skill training, community volunteering and peer mentoring opportunities. \u2022 Raise awareness and understanding of the important role fathers play in the emotional, mental and educational development and well-being of boys. Why we do it: In 2013 the Centre for Social Justice published Fractured Families: Why stability matters, which highlighted an alarming trend of fatherlessness across the UK. It found that a teenager sitting their GCSEs is more likely to own a smartphone than live with their father, (only 57 per cent of 15-year olds are still living with their fathers while 62 per cent own a smartphone), (1). Nationally almost one quarter of families with dependent children are lone-parent families. (2) This figure rises significantly in our poorest neighbourhoods, and can be as high as 75 percent. (3) Blanden (2006) (4), found a father\u2019s low interest in his son\u2019s education, for instance, reduces his boy\u2019s chances of escaping poverty by 25% and at the more extreme end, 76% of all male prisoners in England and Wales had an absent father. Statistically males are the more vulnerable gender when it comes to alcohol and drug misuse, victims of murder, victims of suicide, homelessness. Lads Need Dads was set up to provide a preventative and early-intervention response to an ever-increasing social issue. Our services: \u2018EQUIP\u2019, is a six-month self-development group-work programme held in school including bush-craft and outdoor activities supported by a facilitator and a team of male mentors. Equips\u2019 aim is to help boys cope with problems and issues faced at home and school, and explore the important choices they face in their adolescent development, to prevent escalation of negative behaviour. Engage, a practical life-skill and community volunteering programme follows Equip and takes place in the community for six-months and involves boys attending practical life-skill workshops and together with thier mentors, doing voluntary work for lone parents, pensioners and people with a disability within their local community. Jobs include, DIY, painting and decorating, gardening, shed building, etc. Inspire, a peer mentoring programme incorporating inspirational speakers and visits to inspiring places, completes the 18-month programme. We have run the 18-month pilot once through between March 2016 and August 2017 with excellent outcomes. We started another Equip Programme in May this year. This ended this month (Nov) and the boys off this programme are now attending Engage, the second part of the programme. Alongside the programme we provide on-going support for mums and carers via workshops, coffee mornings and a face-book support group. We raise awareness within the community by giving talks and presentations to community groups, attending public events etc. We run an open-ended check-in group for graduates of the programme one evening a month to keep the arm of support in place, should they need it. We run a fishing club in the summer which is open to any boy on the programme, graduate or new boy who fits our criteria. We are just about to start a guitar club for boys who want to learn to play the guitar but who can't afford lessons. All our services are provided free of charge. We have a growing team of 14 male volunteer male mentors, between the ages of 29 and 70, from a wide range of backgrounds and from the local community. Our Director board is made up of four professionals from education, social care, statutory services and the voluntary sector. We are just entering into our next round of recruitment so anticipate our volunteer numbers increasing.

, {"recipientOrganization": [{"charityNumber": "1080719", "companyNumber": "03898170", "description": "The Balsam Centre was set up by local people to reduce health and social inequalities and promote good health and wellbeing in Wincanton and the surrounding rural area. The Centre works with people for whom there is little or no alternative help and with all ages and stages of life from before birth onwards. Its main aims are to provide opportunities to achieve the following: - The Best Start in Life - Social Inclusion - Mental Health - Community Hub Best Start in Life: Extensive first hand experience has shown us the vital importance of infant and maternal mental health, attachment and good parenting for mental health in childhood and later life. This strand is delivered in two distinct ways. Firstly in partnership with the Local Authority and other agencies as the Balsam Centre is a designated Children's Centre providing both universal and targeted support for pregnant women, children under five and their families. The Balsam Centre is home to both the local Health Visitor and Midwifery teams for the area and provides a venue for additional peer supported or statutory service provision e.g. carer support group, speech and language support, children's social care supervised contacts etc. Secondly, the Centre has set up its own community childcare provision which provides a rich and nurturing environment for children aged 0 - 4 and is run by experienced practitioners able to provide individual family support. Social Inclusion: One of the most common and pervasive problems that the Centre meets is social isolation. The area of benefit and especially the Blackmore Vale area of South Somerset in addition to having its own large ageing population is a popular place for inward migration of older retirees who all too frequently find they have limited social networks to fall back on as they become unwell or lose a partner. Many people both old and young face geographic isolation due to transport difficulties. Further we encounter personal isolation and loneliness that cross cuts all ages and circumstances due to poor physical health, financial difficulties, stigma, relationship or familial breakdown, loss of a partner or mental health problems that leave them isolated. The Centre guides and enables people to become involved in activities such as the Men's Shed, walking groups, gardening and creative and different interest groups initiated by beneficiaries themselves. All involve time spent sociably with others, sharing and learning new skills and finding a sense of belonging. Mental Health: The Centre works with individuals referred or (increasingly) self- referred for common mental health conditions, typically depression or anxiety often leading to self-destructive behaviour. We provide one to one counselling and a range of peer support groups and activities. The Centre has developed a reputation as a safe place to seek help and support. Its work has a strong preventative focus allied to early intervention and uses a 'social model' of health. Common to all activities is that people are given the tools, strategies and the support needed to make changes in their lives. Community Hub The Balsam Centre is a vibrant community hub. The charity owns and manages the building ( a former cottage hospital) and ensures that the activities and services that take place there align with its own aims and values. Balsam Centre staff work seamlessly and effectively with other voluntary and statutory sector partners on site, providing users of the Centre with an inclusive service under one roof. Use of the Centre by different community groups such as Pilates, Painting and Drawing, Tai Chi for Parkinson's, Textile Group, the W.I. and the Japanese Toddler group mean there is a constant flow and exchange of members of the community into the building in line with the Centre's philosophy of welcoming and supporting the whole community.", "name": "The Balsam Centre", "url": "http://www.balsamcentre.org.uk", "id": "GB-COH-03898170", "id_and_name": "[\"The Balsam Centre\", \"GB-COH-03898170\"]"}], "filename": "a001p00000taIwyAAE.json", "Primary age group": "All Ages", "beneficiaryLocation": [{"geoCode": "E01029229", "name": "South Somerset 005D", "geoCodeType": "LSOA", "countryCode": "GB"}], "dataset": {"datagetter_metadata": {"datetime_downloaded": "2018-07-05T10:56:28+00:00", "json": "data/json_all/a001p00000taIwyAAE.json", "file_type": "xlsx", "downloads": true, "acceptable_license": true, "valid": true}, "description": "", "title": "Grants Awarded 2016-17", "license": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "publisher": {"website": "http://www.somersetcf.org.uk/", "prefix": "360G-SomersetCF", "logo": "http://www.threesixtygiving.org/wp-content/uploads/SCF_logo_final_long.jpg", "name": "Somerset Community Foundation"}, "issued": "2017-12-19", "funders": [["Somerset Community Foundation", "GB-COH-04530979"]], "license_name": "Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)", "modified": "2017-12-19T15:39:22+0000", "distribution": [{"title": "Grants Awarded 2016-17", "accessURL": "http://www.somersetcf.org.uk/open", "downloadURL": "http://www.somersetcf.org.uk/uploads/images/SCF2016-17.xlsx"}], "identifier": "a001p00000taIwyAAE"}, "dateModified": "2017-12-13T00:00:00+00:00", "plannedDates": [{"startDate": "2016-10-01T00:00:00+00:00", "endDate": "2017-09-30T00:00:00+00:00", "duration": 11}], "description": "Match funding for mental health project", "awardDate": "2016-08-02T00:00:00+00:00", "Impact Category": "Advance people's physical and mental health, wellbeing and safety", "amountAppliedFor": 5000, "amountAwarded": 4000, "fundingOrganization": [{"name": "Somerset Community Foundation", "id_and_name": "[\"Somerset Community Foundation\", \"GB-COH-04530979\"]", "id": "GB-COH-04530979"}], "currency": "GBP", "title": "Like MInds", "Primary beneficiary": "People with mental health issues", "Primary ethnicity": "White British", "Primary issue": "Mental health", "grantProgramme": [{"title": "Grants to Groups", "code": "June 2016"}], "id": "360G-SomersetCF-A412799"}

We are governed by a Constitution which was revised and accepted by the Charity Commission in 2010. Specialist education settings in early years are not recognised in Somerset and in order to continue to provide our unique service to children and parents we have to rely on additional funding from donations and fundraising. Quote from a parent: \" Thank you to all the team at YOG for your support in the last year. You have all proved highly professional in your expertise dealing with our son and his additional needs. But I think it is also worth mentioning the emotional support you have provided me and my husband during a very stressful , difficult period of diagnosis, EHCP, reviews etc. I think you all deserve credit for the input into our sons life since Sept which has seen him grow in confidence, independence and develop communication skills which a year ago we could have never anticipated. The fundamental aim of the Group is to provide early intervention to support and enhance the development and education of children, irrespective of their race, culture, religion, means of ability and in particular those with additional needs by offering specialised play, education and care facilities. We also play a major role in supporting parents/carers through what can be incredibly difficult and challenging times. The children we work with have a range of additional needs ranging from physical, sensory disabilities, speech and language and/or learning disabilities, a variety of very complex needs and more recently reaching out to those children who have not been able to thrive in mainstream settings and vulnerable families and children, and those needing respite. We provide two core services: Pre-School Sessions:- We are open 5 mornings per week during term time and cater for children aged 18 months to 5 years. We follow the Early Years Foundation Stage Curriculum, however the majority of our children follow the Development Journal method which is more suited to smaller individualised steps in their learning journey and a cause for celebration when each step is achieved. We also encourage, when it is in the best interest for the child, to access main stream settings and work in partnership to provide dual placements. We have an excellent relationship with the many professionals who support our children and their families and it is our aim to ensure a smooth transition into whichever school is the best route for our children, either mainstream or specialist. Rainbows Time Together:- This Group is a very special Group where parents/carers with children with additional needs, probably for the first time, are able to meet each other, the team at YOG and therapists. The Group is kept small to enable parents to have 1:1 discussions with the team and therapists. The Group is led by our Senior Nursery Nurse. The sessions focus on singing, sensory activities, including the sensory room and tactile play. Children and their parents enjoy activities including finger painting, water play, messy paly and lots of other activities without the worry of having to clear up after. There is no charge for this Group and referrals come from the paediatric team at YDH, Health Visitors and other specialists. Children from Dorset and Somerset are welcome to come to Rainbows.

As members of The Scout Association we are committed to being inclusive of all young people, regardless of ability or disability. We have an Equal Opportunities policy and are an inclusive and values-based Movement. We have young people and adults of all faiths and beliefs, including the absence of an affirmed faith, humanists or atheists. West Hatch Scout Group is organised by age group. We currently have 26 Beavers (6-8 years) 32 Cubs (8-10 years) and 30 Scouts (10-14 years). The sections are led by volunteers who provide an exciting and enjoyable Programme of activities in a structured environment that enables everyone to participate and achieve at their own level. We hold weekly meetings during term time and all sections have additional weekend activities including overnight stays throughout the year. Parents comment that their children return from these activities with new skills and greater self-confidence. Sections are led by volunteers. We currently have 7 adult volunteer leaders, 40 parent volunteers and 4 young leaders who have been scouts and returned to support the younger sections. All our volunteers follow an award winning modular training scheme delivered through The Scout Association. Volunteers report they not only get huge enjoyment from Scouting but the skills they learn help them in their jobs and career development. There are enormous inter-generational benefits to this way of working. Recently the scouts had a weekend camp led by someone who had been a scout 60 years ago. They were fascinated by the \u2018the old fashioned way\u2019 of camping. Rewards not only include the achievement of badges and awards but the time to explore and form new interests such as canoeing and pioneering, crafts and charity work. At a recent meeting cubs helped pack bags for Syrian refugees. Parents become volunteers when their children join the Group. They work on a rota of helpers for meeting nights and join working parties and help fundraise. West Hatch Scout Group is renowned locally for it\u2019s sense of community and the terrific support of parents and volunteers that enable a wide range of extra camps and outings to take place in addition to the weekly meetings. We want children and young adults to reach their full potential. The Programmes they follow develop skills including teamwork, leadership, initiative, planning, communication, self-motivation, cultural awareness and commitment. Scouts have fun, forge friendships, get involved and make a positive contribution to society. When our young people move on their experiences make a positive contribution to their CV and Record of Achievement which lead to better employment prospects. We also hope that they become the volunteers of the future in society. In the rural villages east of Taunton, local provision of services and activities for young people is important to maintaining a young and active community. Families pull together and support each other, mums, dads, grandparents and brothers and sisters are often all involved with the West Hatch Scout Group. We are proud of our history in the community of West Hatch and will work towards maintaining it and finding ways to expand.", "id": "GB-CHC-1058494"}], "filename": "a001p00000taIwyAAE.json", "Primary age group": "All Ages", "beneficiaryLocation": [{"geoCode": "E01029270", "name": "Taunton Deane 014B", "geoCodeType": "LSOA", "countryCode": "GB"}], "dataset": {"datagetter_metadata": {"datetime_downloaded": "2018-07-05T10:56:28+00:00", "json": "data/json_all/a001p00000taIwyAAE.json", "file_type": "xlsx", "downloads": true, "acceptable_license": true, "valid": true}, "description": "", "title": "Grants Awarded 2016-17", "license": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "publisher": {"website": "http://www.somersetcf.org.uk/", "prefix": "360G-SomersetCF", "logo": "http://www.threesixtygiving.org/wp-content/uploads/SCF_logo_final_long.jpg", "name": "Somerset Community Foundation"}, "issued": "2017-12-19", "funders": [["Somerset Community Foundation", "GB-COH-04530979"]], "license_name": "Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)", "modified": "2017-12-19T15:39:22+0000", "distribution": [{"title": "Grants Awarded 2016-17", "accessURL": "http://www.somersetcf.org.uk/open", "downloadURL": "http://www.somersetcf.org.uk/uploads/images/SCF2016-17.xlsx"}], "identifier": "a001p00000taIwyAAE"}, "dateModified": "2017-10-19T00:00:00+00:00", "plannedDates": [{"startDate": "2016-10-01T00:00:00+00:00", "endDate": "2016-12-31T00:00:00+00:00", "duration": 2}], "description": "Back to West Hatch", "awardDate": "2016-11-02T00:00:00+00:00", "Impact Category": "Improve life skills, education, employability and enterprise", "amountAppliedFor": 5000, "amountAwarded": 1750, "fundingOrganization": [{"name": "Somerset Community Foundation", "id_and_name": "[\"Somerset Community Foundation\", \"GB-COH-04530979\"]", "id": "GB-COH-04530979"}], "currency": "GBP", "title": "Back to West Hatch", "Primary beneficiary": "Children and Young People", "Primary ethnicity": "White British", "Primary issue": "Environment and improving surroundings", "grantProgramme": [{"title": "Grants to Groups", "code": "September 16"}], "id": "360G-SomersetCF-A421543"}

There are approximately 400,000 new cases each year, mainly in Sudan, South Sudan, India, Bangladesh, Ethiopia and Brazil, with a case fatality rate of ~10%.  Although a handful of drugs are available, efficacy varies geographically and emerging drug resistance is a major threat. In East Africa and South East Asia, the lack of complete efficacy of these drugs can also lead to patients developing a chronic and stigmatizing skin disease, called post kala azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL).  The development of new preventative and/or therapeutic measures to combat this infection is therefore a major international research priority. An international research team, funded by the Wellcome Trust and led by Professor Paul Kaye at the University of York, has developed a new adenovirus-based vaccine for visceral leishmaniasis, which has shown efficacy in animal models and safety and immunogenicity in a human Phase I clinical trial.  This new study will allow the team to evaluate the vaccine for safety and therapeutic efficacy in Sudanese patients with persistent PKDL.  The study will first identify a safe dose of the vaccine to use in adults and children with PKDL and then proceed to test whether a single dose therapeutic immunization can stimulate immune responses leading to clinical cure or reduction in symptoms.  If successful, these clinical trials will determine whether therapeutic vaccination has the potential to be developed further, as an alternative treatment option for patients with PKDL and perhaps other forms of leishmaniasis.", "dataset": {"datagetter_metadata": {"datetime_downloaded": "2018-07-05T10:59:03+00:00", "json": "data/json_all/a001p00000xQ047AAC.json", "file_type": "xlsx", "downloads": true, "acceptable_license": true, "valid": true}, "description": "", "title": "Grants awarded from 1 October 2005 to 30 September 2017", "license": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "publisher": {"website": "https://wellcome.ac.uk", "prefix": "360G-wellcome", "logo": "https://www.threesixtygiving.org/wp-content/uploads/wellcome-logo-black.png", "name": "Wellcome Trust"}, "issued": "2018-03-21", "funders": [["The Wellcome Trust", "GB-CHC-210183"]], "license_name": "Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)", "modified": "2018-03-27T07:02:32+0000", "distribution": [{"title": "Grants awarded from 1 October 2005 to 30 September 2017", "accessURL": "https://wellcome.ac.uk/funding/managing-grant/grants-awarded", "downloadURL": "https://wellcome.ac.uk/sites/default/files/wellcome-grants-awarded-2005-2017_0.xlsx"}], "identifier": "a001p00000xQ047AAC"}, "Applicant Surname": "Kaye", "awardDate": "2015-07-14T00:00:00+00:00", "amountAwarded": 1564336, "Lead Applicant": "Prof Paul Kaye", "fundingOrganization": [{"name": "The Wellcome Trust", "id_and_name": "[\"The Wellcome Trust\", \"GB-CHC-210183\"]", "id": "GB-CHC-210183"}], "Region": "Yorkshire and the Humber", "Approval Committee": "Translation Fund Committee", "currency": "GBP", "title": "A Phase IIa/IIb clinical trial to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of ChAd63-KH vaccine in patients with persistent post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL)\u201d", "Financial Year": "2014/15", "filename": "a001p00000xQ047AAC.json", "plannedDates": [{"startDate": "2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "endDate": "2021-12-31T00:00:00+00:00"}], "grantProgramme": [{"title": "Translation Fund"}], "id": "360G-Wellcome-108518_Z_15_Z"}

A team led by Dr Heather Duncan of Birmingham Children's Hospital NHS Foundation Trust proposes a system where continuous observations are taken from patients and this data is used to understand, in real-time, what is normal for each patient and detect the changing patterns in their physiology. Small chest and hand sensors wirelessly connect patients in the wards. Continuous monitoring allows deterioration to be recognised, triggering an alert and provoking timely intervention to prevent patients suffering further deterioration and death.The technology uses software adapted from Formula 1, with Aston University and Birmingham Children\u2019s Hospital algorithms to interface seamlessly with NHS IT systems.

Design: Village-level cluster randomised controlled trial with two arms of equal size. Interventions: Experimental - The Philips fan-assisted stove with user training (replacing open fires). Control - Continuation of traditional cooking methods (open fire). Randomisation: By matched pairs of villages using computer-based system stratified by district to trial arms in a 1:1 ratio. Target population: Children up to 4.5 years old in Malawi allowing for a minimum of 6 months data collection before a child's 5th birthday. The trial will be broadly inclusive. HIV infection will not be an exclusion criterion. Duration of treatment period and follow-up: 24 months from randomisation. Primary outcome measure: Incidence of pneumonia in children under 5 years of age diagnosed by blinded physicians or medical officers using the WHO Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) pneumonia assessment protocol. Economic, social, qualitative measures: Analyses will be carried out to explore factors that may be relevant for scale up of the intervention in the future. Sample size and potential power of the trial: Randomisation will be at the village level with an expected average number of children per village of 85 (77 after allowing for 10% loss to follow up). The between cluster CV has been set at the conservatively high level of 0.10. The latest data from Malawi suggest that around 9% of control group children will develop pneumonia severe enough to require treatment at a healthcare facility every year.

, {"recipientOrganization": [{"charityNumber": "1091598", "companyNumber": "04365550", "description": "The Cirdan Sailing Trust was established in 1983 and has provided over 33,000 young people from the UK with self-development, integration and learning opportunities through the challenge of life at sea aboard our large sailing vessels. The focus of our service is on working almost exclusively with groups from youth organisations that work with young people whose lives are disadvantaged in some way. A sailing voyage takes the young people away from their geographical surroundings and removes them from their usual environment where they be may be subject to negative influences and other pressures that are detrimental to their development and well-being. Our sailing vessels provide them with a challenging, alien environment where they have to understand and accept authority, live and work as a team and be resilient. They are actively involved in every aspect of running and sailing the vessel. This includes deck work, planning and navigation, keeping watch, learn to cook for themselves and each other and keeping a tidy ship. As their voyage of discovery progresses, the young people learn to accept the disciplines and constraints of life on board and they face up to the challenges that produce the positive outcomes. The Trust is partly self-funding through the collection of voyage fees which, by careful management, are kept as low as possible. However, very few of the organisations and young people who wish to benefit from the experience we offer are in a position to cover the costs involved. They rely on support from our voyage of Discovery Fund scheme to supplement the limited monies raised through their own resources to ensure the experience can be made available to their young people. Most seasons, none of our groups can cover the full voyage fee so all have to supplemented through our Voyage of Discovery Fund scheme. We have always supported the majority of those who sail with at a level dependent upon their particular needs. Over the last few years, our support has risen from an average level of 40% to nearer 60%. We anticipate this trend will continue into the foreseeable future if we are to ensure our service is available to those who can most benefit. The experience we provide for young people makes a significant contribution to the development of their life skills, stimulates their desire to learn, improves their attitude towards authority and generally enhances their health and well-being. Whilst we are not in a position to provide a service for wheelchair users, as all participants do require a degree of mobility and coordination, we work closely with the youth leaders to tailor voyages to the needs of the young people in an effort to make the experience we offer inclusive. Together with the support we provide through our Voyage of Discovery Fund this allows us generally to work with young people from all areas of society irrespective of their culture, religion, attainment level, social standing or special needs. Throughout each season, we receive a great deal of feedback from the youth leaders who involve their young people in sailing residentials on board our vessels. The overriding view of these leaders in that the benefits gained from the experience are of enormous value, in particular with regard to the sense of achievement, self-confidence, and ability to face challenges. Very many of the young people who sail with us have restricted and insular view of life, often relying heavily on others to provide structure and organisation. The challenge off-shore sailing adventure with the rigidity of an on-board life allows the individual to develop naturally through the necessity of cooperation and the feeling of total inclusion as a valued member of the team. The leaders who accompany the young people are encouraged to discuss their desired outcomes with the Skipper prior to and during the voyage.

At the time there were still many people who for various reasons did not have access to a bank account and we were able to provide a financial service which they could not get elsewhere.We are a savings and loans organisation and once a savings record has been established by members they are elligible for small, low cost, affordable loans which are based on their ability to repay them without straining their finances. We help people with budgeting and provide help and advice to those who have got themselves into debt. The burden of personal debt in this country is again rising towards unsustainable levels and helping people to regain control of their finances without resorting to online loan companies at extortionate rates of interest is needed more than ever. As well as the normal savings account we provide a bill paying account which lets people save for the specific bills they know they will have to pay over the course of a year and we also have a Christmas saving account into which people put money over the year ready for the big expenses of the Christmas season. About ten years ago we realised that the best way of helping people to learn how to manage their money was to encourage young people to get into the habit of regular saving at an early age. This is what led to the setting up of our School Saver Scheme which has only been possible with supporting grants from ECF. We make no money from our junior savers as we do not charge for maintaining their accounts and we have always paid them a reward Dividend at the end of each year, however small, although we have not been able to do the same for our adult members for some years. We provide each School Saver with their own pass-book and send out annual statements of how they are doing. We also encourage them to keep up with regular saving by doing school assemblies and each year identify some \"star savers\" who are given a certificate, not according to how much they have saved but how regular they have been in making deposits. Some children only bring in thirty pence a time but they can see how small amounts gradually grow into large savings. Older children are given the opportunity to serve as Collectors under adult supervision and thus develop simple book-keeping skills which again are recognised with a certificate which can go into their Record of Achievement. Through the Scheme we are trying to restore the idea that saving is normal and when done little by little can build into a substantial lifeline for the future.", "id_and_name": "[\"Holdfast Credit Union Limited\", \"360G-EssexCF-ACC033423\"]", "url": "http://www.holdfastcreditunion.co.uk", "id": "360G-EssexCF-ACC033423"}], "filename": "a002400000p0ykGAAQ.json", "Primary age group": "Children (5 \u2013 12)", "beneficiaryLocation": [{"geoCode": "E07000067", "name": "Braintree", "geoCodeType": "NMD", "countryCode": "GB"}], "dataset": {"datagetter_metadata": {"datetime_downloaded": "2018-07-05T10:54:46+00:00", "json": "data/json_all/a002400000p0ykGAAQ.json", "file_type": "xlsx", "downloads": true, "acceptable_license": true, "valid": true}, "description": "", "title": "Essex Community Foundation grants awarded July 2016 to March 2018", "license": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "publisher": {"website": "http://www.essexcommunityfoundation.org.uk/index.php", "prefix": "360G-EssexCF", "logo": "http://www.threesixtygiving.org/wp-content/uploads/ECF_logo.jpg", "name": "Essex Community Foundation"}, "issued": "2017-08-31", "funders": [["Essex Community Foundation", "GB-CHC-1052061"]], "license_name": "Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)", "modified": "2018-04-18T07:08:50+0000", "distribution": [{"title": "Essex Community Foundation grants awarded July 2016 to March 2018", "accessURL": "http://www.essexcommunityfoundation.org.uk/impact/impact/our-grantmaking/", "downloadURL": "http://www.essexcommunityfoundation.org.uk/images/uploads/ECF_Grants_awarded.xlsx"}], "identifier": "a002400000p0ykGAAQ"}, "dateModified": "2018-04-04T00:00:00+00:00", "plannedDates": [{"startDate": "2017-12-01T00:00:00+00:00", "endDate": "2018-12-01T00:00:00+00:00", "duration": 12}], "description": "To continue the school savers scheme across Essex", "awardDate": "2018-03-12T00:00:00+00:00", "Impact Category": "Improve life skills, education, employability and enterprise", "amountAppliedFor": 9000, "amountAwarded": 8000, "fundingOrganization": [{"name": "Essex Community Foundation", "id_and_name": "[\"Essex Community Foundation\", \"GB-CHC-1052061\"]", "id": "GB-CHC-1052061"}], "currency": "GBP", "title": "School Savers Scheme", "Primary beneficiary": "Children and Young People", "Primary ethnicity": "White British", "Primary issue": "Financial exclusion and financial illiteracy", "grantProgramme": [{"title": "Yellow Car Charitable Fund", "code": "2017/18"}], "id": "360G-EssexCF-A463575"}

We do this through the following current initiatives: - Rainbow Services provides infrastructure support to local voluntary and community groups, holding regular meetings and publishing a weekly e-bulletin sharing information on subjects relevant to the sector, giving advice and guidance, delivering workshops on topics such as GDPR, and facilitating a voluntary sector hub with affordable room hire and office space. In 16/17 we sent 50 e-briefings out to over 200 organisations; - Rainbow Services also provides direct services to the local community via our Community Builder project, which is currently supporting local older residents. across Harlow who are socially isolated. This project uses an Asset Based Community Development approach to work with older people to develop sustainable social groups, supported by volunteers, and co-ordinate safety and health information sessions combined with social opportunities. In 16/17 over 900 older people were supported ; -Our Business Engagement project is working to facilitate a more structured approach to Corporate Social Responsibility and to create a better pipeline for business involvement and volunteering opportunities with the wider Voluntary Sector and local community, in partnership with Harlow Chamber of Commerce. Started in August 2017, the project has already engaged with 17 VCSE and 5 business organisations and is in the process of matching 6 volunteer opportunities; - Our Workshop project is a contracted arrangement (with Sodexo) to provide a workplace environment for offenders who have received a community service order through the courts in an environment that is, whilst punitive, also rehabilitative and constructive. This project is the only community and voluntary sector run programme which Sodexo offers in Essex and is creating real opportunities for offenders to give back to their community by building and refurbishing items for local groups and organisations, whilst developing transferable skills which could lead to more positive activities on completion of their order. In 16/17 we enabled the completion of 10,515 unpaid work hours and feedback includes \"I have learnt skills I didn't think were possible\"; - we also promote volunteering both internally and externally, and provide diverse volunteering opportunities within Rainbow Services, including intergenerational, reception, workshop, health programmes, and within communications. These opportunities have been used as springboards to paid employment for many of our volunteers, and for others who require supportive environments we have been able to facilitate learning and development through volunteering. In 16/17 2,984 volunteer hours were completed via Rainbow Services; - we pilot and test new ideas with partners. In previous years this has included a Health Navigation Project, which led to the subsequent development of Care Navigation in West Essex. Currently we are working with groups of VCSE organisations, local and district authority representatives, education providers, and community members to find solutions to youth mental health and youth inactivity in Harlow. In addition to this, in November and December 2017 we worked with Passmores Academy in a test programme they were running to tackle disengagement in education. They released 8 young people in Year 8 who were regularly being sent to the STEP (Students Towards Excellent Progress) team office into community activities, supported by the Alternative Provision Officer (Jo Busson). They tried several different activities, including intergenerational volunteering with Rainbow Services. It was found that the most successful elements of the programme were the intergenerational volunteering with Rainbow, where 2 young boys have continued to volunteer and 1 is considering it, and visits from ex-offenders to discuss their experiences. The young people were also better behaved and focused when doing practical activities which kept them busy. This has led to the development of this Workshop programme, which Passmores is supporting and which has been presented to the Safer Harlow Partnership, members of which have also approved the project and offered support.", "name": "Rainbow Services", "url": "http://www.rainbowservices.org.uk", "id": "GB-COH-03826440", "id_and_name": "[\"Rainbow Services\", \"GB-COH-03826440\"]"}], "filename": "a002400000p0ykGAAQ.json", "Primary age group": "Young People (13 \u2013 18)", "beneficiaryLocation": [{"geoCode": "E01021843", "name": "Harlow 004E", "geoCodeType": "LSOA", "countryCode": "GB"}], "dataset": {"datagetter_metadata": {"datetime_downloaded": "2018-07-05T10:54:46+00:00", "json": "data/json_all/a002400000p0ykGAAQ.json", "file_type": "xlsx", "downloads": true, "acceptable_license": true, "valid": true}, "description": "", "title": "Essex Community Foundation grants awarded July 2016 to March 2018", "license": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "publisher": {"website": "http://www.essexcommunityfoundation.org.uk/index.php", "prefix": "360G-EssexCF", "logo": "http://www.threesixtygiving.org/wp-content/uploads/ECF_logo.jpg", "name": "Essex Community Foundation"}, "issued": "2017-08-31", "funders": [["Essex Community Foundation", "GB-CHC-1052061"]], "license_name": "Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)", "modified": "2018-04-18T07:08:50+0000", "distribution": [{"title": "Essex Community Foundation grants awarded July 2016 to March 2018", "accessURL": "http://www.essexcommunityfoundation.org.uk/impact/impact/our-grantmaking/", "downloadURL": "http://www.essexcommunityfoundation.org.uk/images/uploads/ECF_Grants_awarded.xlsx"}], "identifier": "a002400000p0ykGAAQ"}, "dateModified": "2018-03-02T00:00:00+00:00", "plannedDates": [{"startDate": "2018-04-16T00:00:00+00:00", "endDate": "2019-04-15T00:00:00+00:00", "duration": 12}], "description": "To extend a recycling workshop project in Harlow to young people at risk of exclusion from school to increase their skills and life chances", "awardDate": "2018-02-14T00:00:00+00:00", "Impact Category": "Improve life skills, education, employability and enterprise", "amountAppliedFor": 5360, "amountAwarded": 5308, "fundingOrganization": [{"name": "Essex Community Foundation", "id_and_name": "[\"Essex Community Foundation\", \"GB-CHC-1052061\"]", "id": "GB-CHC-1052061"}], "currency": "GBP", "title": "Rainbow Workshop - we are requesting funding to take the positive effects of our Workshop for offenders to young people disengaging from education and help them to learn new skills and positive behaviours through focused, mentored activity", "Primary beneficiary": "Children and Young People", "Primary ethnicity": "All Ethnicities", "Primary issue": "Education, learning and training", "grantProgramme": [{"title": "Harlow Education Trust", "code": "2017/18"}], "id": "360G-EssexCF-A471926"}

, {"recipientOrganization": [{"name": "Lads Need Dads CIC", "description": "Who we are: Lads Need Dads CIC is a Not-For-Profit Community Interest Company, based in Tendring, North East Essex, set up to prevent potential problems and address existing ones where boys are missing a father figure in their lives. Our Mission: To empower and enable boys aged 11-15 with absent fathers or limited access to a male role model, to be motivated, responsible, capable, resilient and emotionally competent to prevent them from coming at risk of under achieving, offending, exclusion or dropping out of school. What we do: \u2022 Help boys through male-led group mentoring, to cope with problems and issues faced at home and school, and explore the important choices they face in their adolescent development, to prevent escalation of negative behaviour. \u2022 Provide boys with opportunities for adventure, to be tested and challenged, both physically and mentally. \u2022 Provide boys with practical life-skill training, community volunteering and peer mentoring opportunities. \u2022 Raise awareness and understanding of the important role fathers play in the emotional, mental and educational development and well-being of boys. Why we do it: In 2013 the Centre for Social Justice published Fractured Families: Why stability matters, which highlighted an alarming trend of fatherlessness across the UK. It found that a teenager sitting their GCSEs is more likely to own a smartphone than live with their father, (only 57 per cent of 15-year olds are still living with their fathers while 62 per cent own a smartphone), (1). Nationally almost one quarter of families with dependent children are lone-parent families. (2) This figure rises significantly in our poorest neighbourhoods, and can be as high as 75 percent. (3) Blanden (2006) (4), found a father\u2019s low interest in his son\u2019s education, for instance, reduces his boy\u2019s chances of escaping poverty by 25% and at the more extreme end, 76% of all male prisoners in England and Wales had an absent father. Statistically males are the more vulnerable gender when it comes to alcohol and drug misuse, victims of murder, victims of suicide, homelessness. Lads Need Dads was set up to provide a preventative and early-intervention response to an ever-increasing social issue. Our services: \u2018EQUIP\u2019, is a six-month self-development group-work programme held in school including bush-craft and outdoor activities supported by a facilitator and a team of male mentors. Equips\u2019 aim is to help boys cope with problems and issues faced at home and school, and explore the important choices they face in their adolescent development, to prevent escalation of negative behaviour. Engage, a practical life-skill and community volunteering programme follows Equip and takes place in the community for six-months and involves boys attending practical life-skill workshops and together with thier mentors, doing voluntary work for lone parents, pensioners and people with a disability within their local community. Jobs include, DIY, painting and decorating, gardening, shed building, etc. Inspire, a peer mentoring programme incorporating inspirational speakers and visits to inspiring places, completes the 18-month programme. We have run the 18-month pilot once through between March 2016 and August 2017 with excellent outcomes. We started another Equip Programme in May this year. This ended this month (Nov) and the boys off this programme are now attending Engage, the second part of the programme. Alongside the programme we provide on-going support for mums and carers via workshops, coffee mornings and a face-book support group. We raise awareness within the community by giving talks and presentations to community groups, attending public events etc. We run an open-ended check-in group for graduates of the programme one evening a month to keep the arm of support in place, should they need it. We run a fishing club in the summer which is open to any boy on the programme, graduate or new boy who fits our criteria. We are just about to start a guitar club for boys who want to learn to play the guitar but who can't afford lessons. All our services are provided free of charge. We have a growing team of 14 male volunteer male mentors, between the ages of 29 and 70, from a wide range of backgrounds and from the local community. Our Director board is made up of four professionals from education, social care, statutory services and the voluntary sector. We are just entering into our next round of recruitment so anticipate our volunteer numbers increasing.

Specifically, the MAZE Approach examines these 3 key areas of difficulty for additional needs: \u2022 Sensory Processing Difficulties that 95% of ASD children experience and that can explain many unusual or challenging behaviours. \u2022 Communication difficulties that the children experience, which are often not detected even if they present with functional, fluent speech. \u2022 Social Understanding and an exploration of how an impaired ability to make social sense of situations leads to social difficulties, with a focus on the value of Social Stories. We offer training in the Maze Approach to parents, schools and other professionals. In the training for parents (which is what we are asking for partial funding for) we cover: The topics covered are: \u2022Session 1: Introductions \u2022Session 2: Sensory Processing Difficulties \u2022Session 3: Communication Strategies \u2022Session 4: Social Understanding \u2022Session 5: Lifestyle issues (sleep, continence, diet) \u2022Session 6: Behaviour Management - using positive strategies Session 7: Positive Family Relationships \u2022Session 8: Behaviour Management - limit setting and consequences \u2022Session 9: Functional Behaviour Analysis \u2022Session 10: My Childs Development \u2022Session 11: What about me? Building resilience \u2022Session 12: Planning For The Future - moving on Our service users are the parents and carers of children with additional needs. This may be a learning difficulty, physical disability, autism, ADHD, cerebral palsy or any other additional or special need. We have worked with parents of children with a wide range of difficulties. Many parents do not have sufficient knowledge about their child's condition and are not provided with this information on diagnosis. They are often socially isolated because of their child's difficulties, which commonly include challenging behaviour and they also struggle to access appropriate activities out of school hours. These families experience further difficulties with accessing the appropriate education and support for their child, which can result in school exclusions or tribunals. Additionally, the families face difficulties in accessing services such as O/T, speech therapy or short breaks/services through Social Care and also face very restricted leisure opportunities Here\u2019s what our parents have to say about it: \u201cMy life changed. I was lost and I didn\u2019t know what to do. After Maze I have the tools that I need to help myself and my child. My child is happier. Less arguments in my household. Siblings are happy and not fighting.\u201d \u201cMy son has noticed positive changes to his and my relationship as a result of alterations to our lifestyle\u2026I\u2019ve learned so many positive strategies from Sue and other guests and attendees to use at home, and feel very supported.\u201d \u201c[I have] a better understanding of how my daughter thinks, giving me methods to deal with challenging situations\u2026we\u2019re a lot happier.\u201d \u201cIt helped me understand my daughter more\u2026 I see people I can relate with and felt I am not alone.

, {"recipientOrganization": [{"charityNumber": "298643", "description": "Fixers is a champion of youth social action and is the driving force behind giving 16-25 year olds a voice. We reach out into communities to find disadvantaged and isolated young people who build unique projects around issues that matter most to them. Whether it is tackling mental health stigmas, raising awareness of physical disabilities, or discouraging LGBTQ bullying, we work with young people on the subjects close to their hearts. Fixers believes that giving young people a voice is key to helping them reach their full potential: using their disadvantages to transform their lives and the lives of others. All too often, young people do not have a platform through which to campaign about the things they care about. Fixers is dedicated to giving them that platform. The innovative projects can take whichever path that the young people feel will be most effective in their communities. There are six key steps to the project: 1. The Planning Phase Our dedicated Young People\u2019s Coordinator meets with the young people and helps them to decide on the project topic, hone their ideas, create a compelling message and build a solid plan for delivery. The young people will work through their ideas for what needs to be fixed based on their own experiences, why change is needed and identify who needs to hear their voice. All meetings will be held at locations convenient to the young people. 2. The Creative Phase The young people then meet with our professional Creative Resources team and produce the project resource: this could be a film, poster campaign, leaflet or brochure, or any other format; we are led by the young people and their goals for the project. They research existing resources, help write scripts and case studies and have the opportunity to star in their own resource. 3. The Engagement Phase While the resource is being created, the young people, with the help of the YPC, establish connections with organisations in their community which can help by providing content, quotes and further important contacts. 4. The Launch Phase We hold a special launch event in the local area, premiering the completed resource to the target audience within the community. Key influencers will be in attendance; this can include parents, teachers, healthcare professionals, local government representatives and local and national media. The young people share their stories and begin driving their messages out into the public, using their voices to create positive change. 5. The Dissemination Phase Both the resources and young people\u2019s stories are featured on our website and promoted on social media to thousands of people. We have over 30,000 followers on social media and, on average, 3,250 unique visitors for each news story on our website. We also offer a press release and many projects go on to be featured in local and national media. Fixers also works in partnership with ITV News, and once a month in every single region, we have a slot on the local news to showcase a local project. This totals twelve TV slots every month, reaching an audience of over 8 million. 6. The Legacy Phase Once the project has been launched, the young people and their coordinator reflect on their project and plan next steps. We ask young people to evaluate what they set out to do and what they have achieved at the end of their Fixers project and ensure they have plans to continue in the way they wish.", "name": "Public Service Broadcasting Trust Limited", "url": "http://www.fixers.org.uk", "id": "GB-CHC-298643", "id_and_name": "[\"Public Service Broadcasting Trust\", \"GB-CHC-298643\"]"}], "filename": "a002400000p0ykGAAQ.json", "Primary age group": "Young Adults (19 \u2013 25)", "beneficiaryLocation": [{"geoCode": "E01021988", "name": "Tendring 018A", "geoCodeType": "LSOA", "countryCode": "GB"}], "dataset": {"datagetter_metadata": {"datetime_downloaded": "2018-07-05T10:54:46+00:00", "json": "data/json_all/a002400000p0ykGAAQ.json", "file_type": "xlsx", "downloads": true, "acceptable_license": true, "valid": true}, "description": "", "title": "Essex Community Foundation grants awarded July 2016 to March 2018", "license": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "publisher": {"website": "http://www.essexcommunityfoundation.org.uk/index.php", "prefix": "360G-EssexCF", "logo": "http://www.threesixtygiving.org/wp-content/uploads/ECF_logo.jpg", "name": "Essex Community Foundation"}, "issued": "2017-08-31", "funders": [["Essex Community Foundation", "GB-CHC-1052061"]], "license_name": "Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)", "modified": "2018-04-18T07:08:50+0000", "distribution": [{"title": "Essex Community Foundation grants awarded July 2016 to March 2018", "accessURL": "http://www.essexcommunityfoundation.org.uk/impact/impact/our-grantmaking/", "downloadURL": "http://www.essexcommunityfoundation.org.uk/images/uploads/ECF_Grants_awarded.xlsx"}], "identifier": "a002400000p0ykGAAQ"}, "dateModified": "2018-04-16T00:00:00+00:00", "plannedDates": [{"startDate": "2018-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "endDate": "2018-12-31T00:00:00+00:00", "duration": 11}], "description": "To deliver a Fixers project with young disadvantaged people to help them address issues in their community around Jaywick", "awardDate": "2018-03-20T00:00:00+00:00", "Impact Category": "Maximise ability to strengthen community cohesion and build social capacity", "amountAppliedFor": 5000, "amountAwarded": 4000, "fundingOrganization": [{"name": "Essex Community Foundation", "id_and_name": "[\"Essex Community Foundation\", \"GB-CHC-1052061\"]", "id": "GB-CHC-1052061"}], "currency": "GBP", "title": "The 2018 Jaywick Fix", "Primary beneficiary": "Children and Young People", "Primary ethnicity": "All Ethnicities", "Primary issue": "Stronger communities/Community support and development", "grantProgramme": [{"title": "Essex County Council Chairman's Fund", "code": "2017/18"}], "id": "360G-EssexCF-A466570"}

This is achieved through a range of group sessions, individual interventions and awareness raising/training; including respite groups, a schools based one to one programme available to all schools in the district, online support forums, advocacy and information services, training for staff and volunteers working with young people, carers and their families across the district. SCAFT works with young carers aged 6-18 years, and is continuing to see much growth in referrals relating to 6-8year olds over the past year. Support is offered through separate primary and secondary aged respite group sessions, run at two venues across the district to aid ease of access. Each group runs fortnightly giving a total of 8 groups a month. The groups offer respite from their caring responsibilities, a chance to meet and share with others in a similar situation, staff and peer support, art and other creative activities, games and sports and a range of informal and formal learning opportunities. The one to one schools service has continued to grow since being expanded to include primary schools 18 months ago and we have recently increased our staffing to boost capacity in this service. This service gives vital support to young carers unable to access the group evenings due to their caring commitments and is able to provide advocacy to young people struggling to balance their education with the demands of caring on issues such as lateness or absence, late or missed homework, or peer relationships and bullying. SCAFT has now become an accredited ADSAN learning provider in order to increase the range of learning opportunities available to young carers. We are integrating the ASDAN \u2018Stepping Stones\u2019 programme into our primary sessions, aimed at bolstering our younger users learning and social skills to improve their ability to make use of other educational opportunities such as school. The secondary groups will be undertaking a range of more targeted short courses, the first of which is a peer mentoring project to develop our users ability to support each other, with new skills and techniques. We hope that this programme will led to the establishment of Peer based Young Carers Ambassadors in each secondary school to act as a point of first contact for young people finding themselves in a caring role. SCAFT provides adult carers with respite groups, advice and information, counselling and advocacy services, working to reduce social isolation and improve wellbeing. SCAFT is also now looking to establish a support service for parents of children who are carers as a recent pilot project in the north of the county by Action for Family Carers showed a real need for this type of support. We are undertaking a consultation with families to establish the level of need locally and what shape this support should take. We expect this service to utilize our Young Carers Support Workers to work with parents to better support their child, as well as our Adult Carer Support Worker to provide direct support to the parent, such as benefit advice and counselling. ECC\u2019s recent decision not to continue funding lower tier young carers services, in favour of a more targeted needs dependant approach is likely to have a major effect on the need for our services and we are currently investigating how best this can be met as many are likely to fall below the threshold for ECC support, but still be in need. We are also currently investigating the best way to extend our services from term-time only to providing at least some support during school breaks, particularly the long summer holiday.", "name": "Supporting Carers and Families Together", "url": "http://www.scaft.org", "id": "GB-COH-06972805", "id_and_name": "[\"Supporting Carers and Families Together\", \"GB-COH-06972805\"]"}], "filename": "a002400000p0ykGAAQ.json", "Primary age group": "Young People (13 \u2013 18)", "beneficiaryLocation": [{"geoCode": "E01021953", "name": "Rochford 004C", "geoCodeType": "LSOA", "countryCode": "GB"}], "dataset": {"datagetter_metadata": {"datetime_downloaded": "2018-07-05T10:54:46+00:00", "json": "data/json_all/a002400000p0ykGAAQ.json", "file_type": "xlsx", "downloads": true, "acceptable_license": true, "valid": true}, "description": "", "title": "Essex Community Foundation grants awarded July 2016 to March 2018", "license": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "publisher": {"website": "http://www.essexcommunityfoundation.org.uk/index.php", "prefix": "360G-EssexCF", "logo": "http://www.threesixtygiving.org/wp-content/uploads/ECF_logo.jpg", "name": "Essex Community Foundation"}, "issued": "2017-08-31", "funders": [["Essex Community Foundation", "GB-CHC-1052061"]], "license_name": "Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)", "modified": "2018-04-18T07:08:50+0000", "distribution": [{"title": "Essex Community Foundation grants awarded July 2016 to March 2018", "accessURL": "http://www.essexcommunityfoundation.org.uk/impact/impact/our-grantmaking/", "downloadURL": "http://www.essexcommunityfoundation.org.uk/images/uploads/ECF_Grants_awarded.xlsx"}], "identifier": "a002400000p0ykGAAQ"}, "dateModified": "2018-04-04T00:00:00+00:00", "plannedDates": [{"startDate": "2018-04-01T00:00:00+00:00", "endDate": "2019-03-31T00:00:00+00:00", "duration": 11}], "description": "Towards the annual salary of the Service Delivery Manager for young and adult carers in Rochford", "awardDate": "2018-03-20T00:00:00+00:00", "Impact Category": "Promote reduction of isolation and disadvantage and access to local services", "amountAppliedFor": 8915, "amountAwarded": 8915, "fundingOrganization": [{"name": "Essex Community Foundation", "id_and_name": "[\"Essex Community Foundation\", \"GB-CHC-1052061\"]", "id": "GB-CHC-1052061"}], "currency": "GBP", "title": "Service Delivery Manager", "Primary beneficiary": "Carers", "Primary ethnicity": "All Ethnicities", "Primary issue": "Caring responsibilities", "grantProgramme": [{"title": "Diana Tinson Fund", "code": "2017/18"}], "id": "360G-EssexCF-A474145"}

Current Activities \u2013 our main activities include:- \u2022 Youth Clubs for 8 \u2013 18 year olds delivering weekly educational programmes, outdoor trips, sport, music & film programmes, career support and mentoring; \u2022 Volunteering, mentoring and training for local people providing opportunities to gain work experience, training and qualifications; \u2022 Weekly child and support sessions delivering education through play with parenting support, Special Educational Need (SEN) support, healthy eating provision and referral onto other support services for families with young children; \u2022 Sports, health and fitness for people of all ages to motivate them to stay healthy; \u2022 Music and Film workshops aimed at engaging a diverse range of local people through music and film craft; \u2022 Outreach and detached work e.g. weekly \u2018street work\u2019 engaging local youth; Government statistics using the Indices of Deprivation indicates Purfleet is in the 20% most deprived areas in England, therefore services and activities focus on strengthening our community links and local networks that help support the need to address complex socio economic challenges. Working in partnership with many other agencies we regularly seek fresh opportunities to bring new projects to the neighbourhood, bridging gaps in the local provision.", "name": "St Stephen's Community Trust", "url": "http://www.ststephenscommunitytrust.org.uk", "id": "GB-CHC-1143746", "id_and_name": "[\"St Stephen's Community Trust\", \"GB-CHC-1143746\"]"}], "filename": "a002400000p0ykGAAQ.json", "Primary age group": "All Ages", "beneficiaryLocation": [{"geoCode": "E06000034", "name": "Thurrock", "geoCodeType": "UA", "countryCode": "GB"}], "dataset": {"datagetter_metadata": {"datetime_downloaded": "2018-07-05T10:54:46+00:00", "json": "data/json_all/a002400000p0ykGAAQ.json", "file_type": "xlsx", "downloads": true, "acceptable_license": true, "valid": true}, "description": "", "title": "Essex Community Foundation grants awarded July 2016 to March 2018", "license": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "publisher": {"website": "http://www.essexcommunityfoundation.org.uk/index.php", "prefix": "360G-EssexCF", "logo": "http://www.threesixtygiving.org/wp-content/uploads/ECF_logo.jpg", "name": "Essex Community Foundation"}, "issued": "2017-08-31", "funders": [["Essex Community Foundation", "GB-CHC-1052061"]], "license_name": "Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)", "modified": "2018-04-18T07:08:50+0000", "distribution": [{"title": "Essex Community Foundation grants awarded July 2016 to March 2018", "accessURL": "http://www.essexcommunityfoundation.org.uk/impact/impact/our-grantmaking/", "downloadURL": "http://www.essexcommunityfoundation.org.uk/images/uploads/ECF_Grants_awarded.xlsx"}], "identifier": "a002400000p0ykGAAQ"}, "dateModified": "2017-07-26T00:00:00+00:00", "plannedDates": [{"startDate": "2017-07-22T00:00:00+00:00", "endDate": "2017-07-22T00:00:00+00:00", "duration": 0}], "description": "Towards the costs of an annual community event in Purfleet", "awardDate": "2017-05-24T00:00:00+00:00", "Impact Category": "Maximise ability to strengthen community cohesion and build social capacity", "amountAppliedFor": 1300, "amountAwarded": 1300, "fundingOrganization": [{"name": "Essex Community Foundation", "id_and_name": "[\"Essex Community Foundation\", \"GB-CHC-1052061\"]", "id": "GB-CHC-1052061"}], "currency": "GBP", "title": "SSCT Community Fun Day", "Primary beneficiary": "Families/Parents/Lone parents", "Primary ethnicity": "White British", "Primary issue": "Stronger communities/Community support and development", "grantProgramme": [{"title": "Thurrock Fund", "code": "2016/17"}], "id": "360G-EssexCF-A447711"}
, {"recipientOrganization": [{"charityNumber": "1112618", "companyNumber": "04592971", "description": "Fledglings Family Services design and source practical, affordable, good quality products and solutions to everyday problems experienced by children with physical and learning disabilities and health conditions. Our Helpline service team offer emotional support and practical help and we source, supply and design items that help children, for example, to learn to feed independently, become toilet trained, to sit, to stand, to walk, to play, to swim, to access education and to keep children safe from harm. The Helpline team is experienced at providing sensitive emotional support and parents frequently 'open up' over the phone about issues that they would be uncomfortable discussing face-to-face. As one parent said of Fledglings, \"We love that there is somewhere we can find solutions to our problems rather than confused faces! You make us feel nearly normal!\" Fledglings primary purpose in trading is to meet the need of the child and family at the best possible price. We focus on meeting individual need as far as it is possible. Our voluntary income and volunteer labour is what makes this possible, as these, in effect, subsidise the cost of the item. Our objectives are to: \u2022 Increase the independence, physical and mental well-being of children living with disabilities and ill-health conditions \u2022 Support children with disabilities to achieve their educational and developmental potential \u2022 Help children with disabilities and their families/carers to experience greater inclusion in all aspects of everyday life such as education, leisure, recreation and healthcare. \u2022 Inform, facilitate and empower families/carers to support their children and each other. \u2022 Help health/social care professional to better support the child patients and families/carers. \u2022 Enable low income families to access our services and products. We co-ordinate a recycling service so that families can donate or sell at low cost items in good condition that might otherwise go to landfill. Our helpline team also identify additional funding sources for low income families. What makes us unique? Businesses supplying products suitable for disabled children and adults are often only supplying one type of item and are often driven by commercial factors which do not take account of individual need. Disability charities supplying products suitable for disabled children generally do so largely as a means of raising income to support other services. Fledglings gives families the opportunity to purchase most of what they need from one source, saving time and money. \u201cSo great to be able to get so many things we need from just one place\". We also keep stocks of many small inexpensive items that can make all the difference to children but are generally only available in packs. By dividing packs we give parents the chance, with minimum financial outlay, to try an individual item to test its effectiveness. Many families come back time-after-time to purchase items from us as their children grow. One of our social worker users tells us: \u201cThe thing that makes your service stand out from any other is that you understand the needs of our families and that you are willing to go the extra mile to source items and remedy individual needs which no other organisation can do!\u201d From a home-based organisation helping local children and families we have now grown into a national charity helping over 26,000 families a year in every region of the UK (up from 23,000 last year). This growth continues. Families find us through google searches, via word of mouth and through referrals from a wide range of health, education and social care professionals including paediatricians, occupational therapists, speech therapists, GP\u2019s, practice nurses, portage workers, social workers, disability teams, children\u2019s centres, school SEN officers, patient groups and disability charities. Due to our origins and location we are pleased to support a larger number of people in Essex than in other parts of the UK. Currently approximately 1306 families, carers and professionals in Essex are supported by Fledglings (increasing from 952 last year) and accounting for 4.98% of all families. As a proportion of the overall running costs (projected at \u00a3411164 in 2017-2018) the cost of supporting families in Essex is approximately \u00a320,475. A recent example of how we have helped a family in Essex is given below; X contacted us in August 2016 to see if we could offer help and advice for her son Y referred from Grove Cottage. Her son has an undiagnosed genetic abnormality, global developmental delay, hyper mobility and is non-verbal. X\u2019s main concern is her son\u2019s severe head banging and his sensory issues. Y has no sense of danger and a very high pain threshold and will bruise and hurt himself so badly that he has to wear a helmet 24/7.Y doesn\u2019t sleep well and recently put his head through a wall when he got out of bed . Y will also rock obsessively, especially at meal times when he is in his high chair. This makes feeding him hard. and pulling at his mother\u2019s hair. Fledglings provided detailed information and advice on safe options for sleeping, a safe and secure high chair that he cannot rock, a safe car seat, secure walking reins, products to help with teeth brushing, a large special needs buggy, sensory toys and solutions, and therapies that are available. We also recommended funding programmes to help towards the cost of the products, therapies and hospital visits. We made a follow up call to X in May 2017 to ask how she was getting on. Things have improved for X. More teams became involved with her family and funding has been secured for the padded room which has, in X\u2019s words, been \u2018life changing\u2019. Y is much happier, he is sleeping through the night, he is less tired, doesn\u2019t bang his head as much and is now much more affectionate \u2013 \u2018a different little boy\u2019. The high chair has helped Y to feed better and the changes in the family situation have been a \u2018miracle\u2019. Y is a different boy who will be attending a special school soon.", "name": "Fledglings Family Services", "url": "http://www.fledglings.org.uk", "id": "GB-COH-04592971", "id_and_name": "[\"Fledglings Family Services\", \"GB-COH-04592971\"]"}], "filename": "a002400000p0ykGAAQ.json", "Primary age group": "Children (5 \u2013 12)", "beneficiaryLocation": [{"countryCode": "GB"}], "dataset": {"datagetter_metadata": {"datetime_downloaded": "2018-07-05T10:54:46+00:00", "json": "data/json_all/a002400000p0ykGAAQ.json", "file_type": "xlsx", "downloads": true, "acceptable_license": true, "valid": true}, "description": "", "title": "Essex Community Foundation grants awarded July 2016 to March 2018", "license": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "publisher": {"website": "http://www.essexcommunityfoundation.org.uk/index.php", "prefix": "360G-EssexCF", "logo": "http://www.threesixtygiving.org/wp-content/uploads/ECF_logo.jpg", "name": "Essex Community Foundation"}, "issued": "2017-08-31", "funders": [["Essex Community Foundation", "GB-CHC-1052061"]], "license_name": "Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)", "modified": "2018-04-18T07:08:50+0000", "distribution": [{"title": "Essex Community Foundation grants awarded July 2016 to March 2018", "accessURL": "http://www.essexcommunityfoundation.org.uk/impact/impact/our-grantmaking/", "downloadURL": "http://www.essexcommunityfoundation.org.uk/images/uploads/ECF_Grants_awarded.xlsx"}], "identifier": "a002400000p0ykGAAQ"}, "dateModified": "2018-03-22T00:00:00+00:00", "plannedDates": [{"startDate": "2017-04-01T00:00:00+00:00", "endDate": "2018-03-31T00:00:00+00:00", "duration": 11}], "description": "To help with the running costs of the helpline service provided by a national charity based in Essex supporting families with disabled children", "awardDate": "2017-10-19T00:00:00+00:00", "Impact Category": "Advance people's physical and mental health, wellbeing and safety", "amountAppliedFor": 10000, "amountAwarded": 10000, "fundingOrganization": [{"name": "Essex Community Foundation", "id_and_name": "[\"Essex Community Foundation\", \"GB-CHC-1052061\"]", "id": "GB-CHC-1052061"}], "currency": "GBP", "title": "Contribution to the costs of running our core helpline service for children and families in Essex", "Primary beneficiary": "Children and Young People", "Primary ethnicity": "White British", "Primary issue": "Disability and Access issues", "grantProgramme": [{"title": "Multiple Funding", "code": "2017/18"}], "id": "360G-EssexCF-A449254"}

In addition, we support students to incubate new volunteering project and social enterprise, such as board games to help encourage engagement in STEM subjects or a language exchange between students studying arabic and refugees. Lastly, to engage students in our activities and the issues they tackle, we held 112 events last academic year, ranging from volunteer fairs to workshops on tackling loneliness.", "name": "Oxford Hub", "url": "http://www.oxfordhub.org", "id": "GB-CHC-1122328", "id_and_name": "[\"Student Hubs\", \"GB-CHC-1122328\"]"}], "beneficiaryLocation": [{"geoCode": "E01028521", "name": "Oxford 008A", "geoCodeType": "LSOA", "countryCode": "GB"}], "dataset": {"datagetter_metadata": {"datetime_downloaded": "2018-07-05T10:56:05+00:00", "json": "data/json_all/a002400000t6UfGAAU.json", "file_type": "xlsx", "downloads": true, "acceptable_license": true, "valid": true}, "description": "", "title": "Grants awarded FY 2017-18", "license": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/", "publisher": {"website": "http://oxfordshire.org/", "prefix": "360G-ocf", "logo": "", "name": "Oxfordshire Community Foundation"}, "issued": "2017-11-29", "funders": [["Oxfordshire Community Foundation", "GB-CHC-1151621"]], "license_name": "Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 4.0", "modified": "2018-03-21T12:38:16+0000", "distribution": [{"title": "Grants awarded FY 2017-18", "accessURL": "http://oxfordshire.org/footer/open/", "downloadURL": "https://3p50ut4bws5s2uzhmycc4t21-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/OCF-Grants_FY17-18_21mar.xlsx"}], "identifier": "a002400000t6UfGAAU"}, "dateModified": "2018-02-09T00:00:00+00:00", "description": "Oxford Hub creates opportunities for social action.

A series of mini-games, which will use art and ?Alice in Wonderland? themes to introduce our areas of scientific focus in a friendly and engaging way. The mini-games will be designed so that players acquire some basic information about the science of brain development through their play. 2.

The interactive nature of the video will give the feeling of having a conversation with the expert. 3. The website itself, which holds all the content together and allows users to navigate and find information to support the scientific themes explored in the mini games and videos, linking out to further information where relevant and necessary.

, {"recipientOrganization": [{"name": "Maze Cares", "description": "Maze Cares provides a welcoming and friendly environment for parent and carers of children with special needs to meet for social interaction, friendship, support, and advice. Through the MAZE Course, which runs for 12 weeks, taking up to 30 parents per course, we help parents better understand and meet the needs of their children. In addition, we offer other support services including monthly coffee mornings, events, speakers, activities, and workshops. Additionally, Maze Cares collaborates with other organisations, voluntary and community sector partners, acting as a signpost to other relevant support, advice and advocacy services. The MAZE Course is a unique approach which aims to develop parent\u2019s knowledge and skills to positively parent their children with disabilities/additional need, such as learning difficulty, autism, ADHD and many other additional needs (SEN/AEN). This work aims to improve family relationships, build social networks of parents and reduce social isolation. The MAZE also aims to empower parents to work towards improving educational outcomes, leisure, and community access opportunities and improving life chances for their children with additional needs. Our funding proposal is for the 12 months from September 2017 to September 2018. Our service users are the parents and carers of children with additional needs. This may be a learning difficulty, physical disability, autism, ADHD, cerebral palsy or any other additional or special need. We have worked with parents of children with a wide range of difficulties. Many parents do not have sufficient knowledge about their child's condition and are not provided with this information on diagnosis. They are often socially isolated because of their child's difficulties, which commonly include challenging behaviour and they also struggle to access appropriate activities out of school hours. These families experience further difficulties with accessing the appropriate education and support for their child, which can result in school exclusions or tribunals. Additionally, the families face difficulties in accessing services such as O/T, speech therapy or short breaks/services through Social Care and also face very restricted leisure opportunities. When parents better understand the additional needs their child has, they are better equipped to raise them. This increased understanding leads to happier parents, happier children and happier siblings, who enjoy a calmer more stable home life, and as a result experience better physical and mental well-being. This is consistently reflected in the feedback we gather at the end of each course. We also hear from parents that after the course they feel empowered by the information and knowledge they have gained. Here\u2019s what our parents have to say about it: \u201cMy life changed. I was lost and I didn\u2019t know what to do. After Maze I have the tools that I need to help myself and my child. My child is happier. Less arguments in my household. Siblings are happy and not fighting.\u201d \u201cMy son has noticed positive changes to his and my relationship as a result of alterations to our lifestyle\u2026I\u2019ve learned so many positive strategies from Sue and other guests and attendees to use at home, and feel very supported.\u201d \u201c[I have] a better understanding of how my daughter thinks, giving me methods to deal with challenging situations\u2026we\u2019re a lot happier.\u201d \u201cIt helped me understand my daughter more\u2026 I see people I can relate with and felt I am not alone. This session is making me strong\u2026.best course I have ever done for my daughter and myself.\u201d \u201cI feel better able to communicate with my child confidently.\u201d We have a hundreds of feedback forms filled with comments like this and 99.6% of parents highly recommend the MAZE. Benefits generated by the Maze Approach include: * Improved family relationships. * Calmer households and families. * Improved understanding and use of positive strategies * Reduced social isolation as our attendees establish a peer support network. * Improved educational provision as parents & carers are more able to advocate for their child, and work with education professionals to ensure their needs are met. * More positive engagement between professionals (including healthcare) and parents. * Improved educational outcomes \u2013 better attendance and reduction in exclusions. * Reduced reliance on mental health services for both parents and children \u2013 we have consistent feedback from parents that they feel stronger, more resilient and better supported * Access to ongoing support for an unlimited amount of time and access to this ensures constant progress and stability for our families. To create a sustainable funding model, we would like to trial a year of requesting parental contributions, and analyse: * how many parents are able to make the contribution. * what impact this model has on the number of places requested. * what impact this model has on the % of sessions attended by parents. In order to run this trial we first need: * To create efficient and sustainable administrative systems to cope with the volume of referrals we are handling (pediatricians, EWMHS, Barnardos and other local family support workers refer to us).

Objectives: 1)To help 50% more people 2) To increase capacity in the volunteer workforce by 50% 3) To double current level of unrestricted income 4) To ensure that no relevant government initiative takes place without IPSEA input IPSEA aims to help parents to support their children and young people with special educational needs and/or disabilities (SEND) to obtain appropriate education and training that is a legal requirement under the Children and Family Act 2014. We also advise local and national government on legislation, policies and implementation relating to SEN. We provide support and advice to parents/carers of children and young people with SEND. All our advice and support is delivered by our dedicated volunteers, supported by a small staff team. IPSEA is a user-led organisation. Many of our volunteers, staff, members and trustees are parents/carers of children or young people with SEND. We have developed a website with a raft of resources that are downloadable free for parents. This is complemented by a separate advice line which provides legally based information and next step advice on any educational issues that is a result of the child\u2019s or young persons SEND. The tribunal helpline gives next step advice on appeals and disability discrimination claims to the SEND Tribunal, this is also the gateway to our Tribunal Support Service where a referral can be made for more extensive support from a volunteer. Making a SEND tribunal appeal is very complicated. The appeal system involves vast amounts of paperwork, evidence has to be gathered from professional witnesses & there is a complex timetable with multiple deadlines. There is no Legal Aid for representation at hearings. There is limited Legal Aid to assist with preparing a case. Lawyers charge up to \u00a310,000 to prepare & represent these tribunal cases. Meanwhile the Local Authorities against whom these appeals are registered have teams of lawyers to prepare their case and representing them at the tribunal hearing. IPSEA's unique Tribunal Support Service addresses this need - free of charge. IPSEA has highly trained volunteers who act as individual caseworkers for SEND Tribunal appeals. These Tribunal Support volunteers complete our accredited legally-based tribunal training in order to provide individual casework support and advocacy for children throughout their tribunal appeal. Access to this specialised service is only available via our Tribunal Helpline. Volunteers with experience of supporting appeals on behalf of children to the SEND Tribunal cover this specialist helpline, using their accredited legally-based IPSEA training and casework experience to offer next-step tribunal appeal support over the telephone. If a child needs individual casework support, our Tribunal Helpline volunteers refer them to our Tribunal Support service. The criteria for this referral are based on the child's household income, the complexity of the child's appeal and whether the child's family can cope with the appeal process. This referral process allows us to offer the most support to the most disadvantaged children. We carefully match each tribunal appeal to a volunteer with the right experience. Our volunteer represents the child throughout their appeal process; managing the timetable, gathering/compiling evidence, helping with paperwork and attending the hearing to advocate for the child against the Local Authority lawyers. Our volunteers won 86% of their appeals in 2015. IPSEA also provides a wide range of training for parents, School Staff, Parent Forums, support groups and other groups and organisations in order to empower users with information and increase their confidence.We developed unique training on the SEND reforms. We have already trained 2,000 people from other organisations this year. We work in partnership with the National Parent Partnership Network (now IASS), training their staff on the SEND reforms. Where we are involved in tribunals our legal team write briefings and resources in order to disseminate and share the learning.

, {"recipientOrganization": [{"charityNumber": "225920", "description": "The Issue: The UK has one of the worst rates for social mobility in the developed world. Almost 4 million children in the UK today are living in low-income households. These young people face many barriers beyond their control throughout their early lives that have a significant impact on their future. For example, young people from low-income homes with similar GCSEs to their better-off classmates are one third more likely to drop out of education at 16, and for the ones that do continue they are 30% less likely to study A-levels that could get them into a top university. All of this means that just one out of every eight young people from low-income backgrounds go on to become a high-income earner later in life. And even for those that do fulfil their potential; get good qualifications and progress into professional careers, they are paid an average of \u00a36,800 less per year than their colleagues from more affluent families. This is what low social mobility means for real people, every day. Communities across the UK, not just in the north, are being left behind. Not only is it not fair, it is also an incredible waste of talent and ability. Furthermore, low social mobility is estimated to cost the UK economy up to \u00a3140bn per year by 2050. Villiers Park Educational Trust is a national charity working to improve social mobility in the UK by supporting less advantaged high potential young people to succeed in education and careers. We do this by equipping these young people with essential skills and providing greater access to opportunities. Everything we do is about supporting young people to build these core skills, so that they can thrive throughout their education and careers. Each year we directly work with almost 2000 students through our range of programmes. Our regionally based Scholars Programme is an unprecedented four-year programme for participating students, providing mentoring, skills workshops, university and career interactions, and residential visits designed to build on subject specific knowledge and promote further education. Our innovative INVOLVE awards scheme sees student-led projects delivered to secondary beneficiaries at a ratio of 5:1. This not only builds leadership and project management skills of students undertaking INVOLVE, but also passes on educational skills to the secondary beneficiaries, and helps to create a culture of learning and raised aspirations within schools. In addition, our renowned Inspiring Excellence residential programme is our longest running programme of subject specific week long courses \u2013 bringing able students from across the UK together to experience a vibrant and inspiring learning environment. The courses run throughout the year for students to study at degree level, undertake unique visits to relevant companies and organisations, and be taught by young leaders in the field. The Activity \u2013 Inspiring Excellence: Villiers Park has been running residential courses for over 50 years, and have outstanding data that evidences the impact on young people who take part. The Inspiring Excellence courses provide able students with a challenging and transformational experience that provides lasting impact. High potential A-level students from state schools stay in groups of 25 for five days to study their chosen subject at university level, and experience independent learning and staying away from home. The courses are designed to improve skills, raise aspirations and increase awareness of the range of opportunities available to help students reach their potential. Each year we run 32 courses on a wide spectrum of subjects covering science, technology, engineering, maths, English, humanities & arts. Over 800 students take part, building essential skills such as team work, resilience, leadership and independence. During these five-day subject-specific residential courses, students are introduced to the latest ideas and research, allowing them to explore challenging topics in subjects across the sciences, arts and humanities. Teamwork, research, presentation skills and creativity are important features of our courses, helping participants to develop key study and employability skills. The academic, motivational and social benefits of attending are strong, as testified by teachers, university admissions tutors, and most importantly by the students themselves. Specifically our courses set out to: \u2022 Provide an insight into university-level material by studying a wide range of exciting topics \u2022 Challenge students to stretch the limit of their abilities with a group of like-minded students in a supportive and non-competitive environment \u2022 Offer active learning experience through workshops, group discussions and presentations \u2022 Develop important skills to ensure academic success and employability This nationally acclaimed programme is listed on the UCAS application form as evidence of preparation for higher education. Furthermore, references to specific aspects of our courses within personal statements are frequently picked up on and made a focus of during university interviews. Lasting impact: 23% of all state school students, compared to 65% of all independently schooled students, progressed to the most selective universities. In contrast, last year 76% of students taking part in an Inspiring Excellence course secured a place at a leading university. Feedback is consistently good, whether five, ten or even thirty years on: \u201cIn 1983 I attended the history short course at Villiers Park, it is no exaggeration to say that it was a life changing experience. As a 16 year old from a family with no previous experience of university, at a school where no previous students had gone to university I didn\u2019t know anyone who had applied to or gone to university. So while determined I lacked real confidence in my ability to apply and be successful and was really worried about \u201cfitting in\u201d and being good enough should I be successful.

With welfare reform and lack of employment opportunity this is leading to deterioration in many families and individuals mental health. The communication barrier faced by many Deaf in our society is a huge hurdle that needs to be addressed. Rather than valuable members of our society being left at home we need to put things in place to enable them to access and have the same rights as their hearing counterparts. We already have strong links with other advice agencies such as North Lanarkshire Disability Forum and CAB. Through these links we would be able to signpost and provide the much-needed advice to the Deaf community. Our communication support worker will be there to translate from BSL to English. Within the Deaf community there is a very high unemployment rate. This was highlighted in the information gathering in the lead up to the British Sign Language (Scotland) Act 2015 being approved. Many young Deaf and deaf families live in poverty and are unaware of changes to the welfare system due to nothing being sent out in their own language of BSL.

, {"recipientOrganization": [{"charityNumber": "1170940", "companyNumber": "10348139", "description": "Home-Start Essex (HSE) is a leading family support charity based in Essex working to achieve healthy and positive outcomes for children and families. Our work comprises a long-established volunteer home visiting service, offering emotional and practical help to families experiencing difficulties, alongside a range of family groups, well-being programmes, courses and events. What makes our charity special, is that all our trained volunteers have lived experience as parents/carers themselves. We believe in the power of community mobilisation, and so invest in local areas to support local families. Our Vision is: \u2018For every child and young person in Essex to grow up in a family that is strong, resilient and able to access the support they need; when and where they need it\u2019 HSE recognises that bringing up children can be hard work. All parents and carers will, from time to time, encounter problems which make the task harder. The key to success is for parents and carers to be strong and resilient, so they can meet challenges head on, and navigate their way through or around them successfully. Through mobilising hundreds of volunteers, we support families to help themselves, developing parenting skills and improving connections in their community. Our volunteers support families struggling with: \u2022 Mental Health issues (including peri/post-natal depression, etc.) \u2022 Financial hardship \u2022 Physical health issues \u2022 Single parenthood \u2022 Low self-esteem and confidence \u2022 Domestic abuse \u2022 Isolation \u2022 Routines and boundaries \u2022 Bereavement and other significant life events The main activities of HSE are as follows: \u2022 Home-Visiting service, led by volunteers \u2022 Family Groups \u2022 School Readiness programme (e.g. Big Hopes-Big Futures) \u2022 Peri/post-natal support groups \u2022 Targeted mental health and wellbeing programmes \u2022 Counselling \u2022 Volunteer training and recruitment \u2022 Information, Advice, Guidance (IAG) and signposting \u2022 Food Bank Voucher distribution \u2022 Family activity days Our main funders are The Big Lottery Fund, BBC Children in Need, Virgin/Banardo\u2019s PB-19yrs Contract, Essex Community Foundation, Clinical Commissioning Groups and local trusts. A new 5-Year Strategic Plan will be launched in March 2018 which will see HSE developing its funding streams to be more diverse; allowing the organisation to grow and build on excellent practice. Since April 2017, HSE has supported 368 families and 755 children, with over 200 trained volunteers offering 1,834 home visits, totalling 3,006 hours\u2019 time across Essex. 95% of all frontline delivery continues to be entirely volunteer led. It is currently estimated that over the course of one year, the value of HSE volunteer time will be over \u00a372,000 (ONS figures https://goo.gl/Uwz2cz). HSE measures impact across 14 individual areas of need (e.g. isolation, mental health, family conflict, etc.) with over 80% of families showing significant positive change. \u201cMy volunteer made a huge difference. Someone who\u2019s not going to judge and always took the time to stop and listen\u201d. We know that our model allows us to engage with those who would otherwise be considered \u2018hard to reach\u2019. Families frequently tell us the impact of a volunteer, giving their time freely, can be far more meaningful than a paid statutory professional. Isolation and mental health issues remain the top two concerns for most of the families we support, and this often means their ability to access mainstream services is limited. This provides HSE a unique opportunity to implement our proposed PICoD Project (Preventative IAG Co-Design) project; a three-year co-produced, family-led process that will develop a new model of information, advice and guidance (IAG). This will be aimed at those predominantly in the peri/post-natal period; a key period for those at risk of poor mental health and well-being. As an existing provider of peri/postnatal services in Harlow, and with a strong history of peer/ volunteer led practice, HSE are ideally positioned to lead on the project; building on our expertise and ability to engage families; ensuring that their voice is not only heard, but responded to in practical, real terms. HSE are confident that the project is deliverable as commitment has been tested with partners (e.g. Virgin/Banardo\u2019s and University of Essex (UofE)) who say objectives are both realistic and achievable. By drawing on our existing network of partners, and engagement with families, HSE are keen to shape the future of family led practice. We believe this is achievable by harnessing the voices and opinions of service users as a tool; to shape and influence the way in which future information, advice and service delivery is commissioned. At HSE, our approach to project design, development and delivery is thorough and systematic. At concept stage, HSE appoints a Project Lead and a Project Delivery Team to draft delivery plans (in a standard format) and undertake initial research. This involves liaising with stakeholders (staff, service users, potential funders and partners, etc.); testing project feasibility; identifying resource needs; establishing project milestones/dependencies/budgets; and undertaking SWOT analysis. This forms the foundation for funding applications/development, as part of the new 2018 Funding Strategy. Upon funding success, our Development Team hands over to the Project Delivery Team, who refine proposals and manage the initiative on an ongoing basis, reporting back to Management, Trustees and Funders in a structured way. This gives assurance to stakeholders involved, that the way HSE delivers projects, is transparent and well managed.", "name": "Home-Start Essex", "url": "http://www.home-startessex.org.uk", "id": "GB-COH-10348139", "id_and_name": "[\"Home-Start Essex\", \"GB-COH-10348139\"]"}], "Primary issue": "Social inclusion and fairness", "beneficiaryLocation": [{"geoCode": "E07000070", "name": "Chelmsford", "geoCodeType": "NMD", "countryCode": "GB"}], "dataset": {"datagetter_metadata": {"datetime_downloaded": "2018-07-05T10:54:46+00:00", "json": "data/json_all/a002400000p0ykGAAQ.json", "file_type": "xlsx", "downloads": true, "acceptable_license": true, "valid": true}, "description": "", "title": "Essex Community Foundation grants awarded July 2016 to March 2018", "license": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "publisher": {"website": "http://www.essexcommunityfoundation.org.uk/index.php", "prefix": "360G-EssexCF", "logo": "http://www.threesixtygiving.org/wp-content/uploads/ECF_logo.jpg", "name": "Essex Community Foundation"}, "issued": "2017-08-31", "funders": [["Essex Community Foundation", "GB-CHC-1052061"]], "license_name": "Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)", "modified": "2018-04-18T07:08:50+0000", "distribution": [{"title": "Essex Community Foundation grants awarded July 2016 to March 2018", "accessURL": "http://www.essexcommunityfoundation.org.uk/impact/impact/our-grantmaking/", "downloadURL": "http://www.essexcommunityfoundation.org.uk/images/uploads/ECF_Grants_awarded.xlsx"}], "identifier": "a002400000p0ykGAAQ"}, "dateModified": "2018-04-11T00:00:00+00:00", "description": "To provide a holiday for a Home-Start family", "awardDate": "2018-03-26T00:00:00+00:00", "amountAppliedFor": 0, "amountAwarded": 1000, "fundingOrganization": [{"name": "Essex Community Foundation", "id_and_name": "[\"Essex Community Foundation\", \"GB-CHC-1052061\"]", "id": "GB-CHC-1052061"}], "currency": "GBP", "title": "Grant to Home-Start Essex", "Primary beneficiary": "Families", "filename": "a002400000p0ykGAAQ.json", "grantProgramme": [{"title": "Daphne Woodward Home-Start Fund", "code": "2017/18"}], "id": "360G-EssexCF-A476535"}

The Association is registered under the Co-operative and Community Benefit Societies Act 2014 (registration no. 15210R) and the Homes and Communities Agency (registration no. LH 2429). Saha provides accommodation for a range of different people, young and old. Our support services help people to develop their personal talents, flourish and live independently. Our principal activities are the development and management of social housing, primarily for single people. This includes Lifehouses for homeless people, Foyers offering support and training and housing with appropriate support services for vulnerable people. Braintree Foyer is managed and owned by the Salvation Army Housing Association. The Foyer provides accommodation, support and training for 35 people aged 18 \u2013 35 who have experienced homelessness. Braintree Foyer was officially opened in November 1994 as the first purpose built foyer in the UK. Since it opened the foyer has provided accommodation, support and training for over 1000 young people from the Braintree District. In recent years the foyer has been increasingly recognised as an exceptional service and was only the second service ever to receive the Foyer Federation Transformational Innovation Award. In 2016 Braintree Foyer was a finalist of the Essex \u2018Who Will Care\u2019 Innovation Award. Over the past 6 years the Foyer has had an 86% success rate of young people making a positive move on from the foyer. The foyer is always fully occupied and has a waiting list. Braintree Foyer regularly receives visits from international organisations who want to learn about the foyer service. At the last service review undertaken by Essex County Council, Braintree Foyer was commended as, \u2018showing how innovative and creative ideas can support young people to reach goals. The service has a \u2018can do\u2019 attitude and approach and is very warm and welcoming to both service users and the wider community. The staff are engaged and committed to the work they do with their young people and encourage individual learning with an aim to develop independent living skills. Management are focused and open to experiment with new innovative ideas that can assist in developing the above. The service shares good practice with other partners and has an open door policy to share the services good practice\u2019. Braintree Foyer residents come to us from very chaotic backgrounds, having suffered abuse, family breakdown or substance misuse and have been sleeping rough or sofa surfing. Our residents also include care leavers, young people with learning difficulties and mental health issues; they are vulnerable young adults with low self-esteem who find it hard to see a positive future. Many take prescription anti-depressants and self-harming is common. However Braintree Foyer is a service which sees the potential in all young people and which focuses on the person rather than the problem. We challenge young people to be the best that they possibly can by nurturing and promoting young people\u2019s talents and aspirations. Braintree Foyer also supports many young people from the local community through its project work including: Braintree Discovery College Braintree Discovery College was launched in April 2015 to provide a broad curriculum of free courses with the aim of reigniting a love of learning in people who have experienced disadvantage in their lives. Braintree Discovery College removes the barriers to learning and empowers young people take control of their own personal development. Braintree Discovery College offers courses which are completely on the learners own terms and as a result it has been very successful in engaging hard to reach young people. Courses are delivered by volunteers from the local community and further afield. We have high calibre volunteer tutors at the Discovery College including academics, CEO's, authors, campaigners and people who will inspire our young people such as the Paralympian Anne Wafula Strike and the former world champion natural bodybuilder Alun Davies. Since the launch in 2015 over 400 young people have enrolled as students of Braintree Discovery College and more than 1200 sessions have been delivered. Braintree Foyer Community Gym Braintree Foyer Community Gym was opened in 2010 to offer a fully equipped free gym for young people who live at the foyer and people from our local community. Since then more than 300 people have used the gym and completed gym inductions and personal training plans with our gym instructors. At any one time there are 70+ regular active users of the gym. In addition to personal training the Gym offers fitness boot camps, circuit training and the 'Ladies that Lift' Programme which encourages young women to use weight training as part of their excercise. The people from the local community who use our gym are people who would be unable to afford gym memberships at commercial gyms. The Foyer is committed to improving the health and wellbeing of young people. Braintree Sound Academy Braintree Sound Academy was established in 2012 to offer free music workshops and live gigs for young people from Braintree District. The project offers workshops 3 evenings per week and intensive week long courses during the school holidays. Workshops include guitar lessons, drum lessons, singing, sound recording, sound engineering, song writing and DJ and MC workshops At the end of each course is a live gig and since 2012 more than 10,000 people have seen young people from Braintree Sound Academy perform at music festivals, Bocking Arts Theatre and even the Royal Opera House.", "name": "Salvation Army Housing Association", "url": "https://saha.org.uk/", "id": "GB-CHC-15210R", "id_and_name": "[\"Salvation Army Housing Association\", \"GB-CHC-15210R\"]"}], "filename": "a002400000p0ykGAAQ.json", "Primary age group": "Young Adults (19 \u2013 25)", "beneficiaryLocation": [{"geoCode": "E07000067", "name": "Braintree", "geoCodeType": "NMD", "countryCode": "GB"}], "dataset": {"datagetter_metadata": {"datetime_downloaded": "2018-07-05T10:54:46+00:00", "json": "data/json_all/a002400000p0ykGAAQ.json", "file_type": "xlsx", "downloads": true, "acceptable_license": true, "valid": true}, "description": "", "title": "Essex Community Foundation grants awarded July 2016 to March 2018", "license": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "publisher": {"website": "http://www.essexcommunityfoundation.org.uk/index.php", "prefix": "360G-EssexCF", "logo": "http://www.threesixtygiving.org/wp-content/uploads/ECF_logo.jpg", "name": "Essex Community Foundation"}, "issued": "2017-08-31", "funders": [["Essex Community Foundation", "GB-CHC-1052061"]], "license_name": "Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)", "modified": "2018-04-18T07:08:50+0000", "distribution": [{"title": "Essex Community Foundation grants awarded July 2016 to March 2018", "accessURL": "http://www.essexcommunityfoundation.org.uk/impact/impact/our-grantmaking/", "downloadURL": "http://www.essexcommunityfoundation.org.uk/images/uploads/ECF_Grants_awarded.xlsx"}], "identifier": "a002400000p0ykGAAQ"}, "dateModified": "2018-02-14T00:00:00+00:00", "plannedDates": [{"startDate": "2016-04-01T00:00:00+00:00", "endDate": "2017-03-31T00:00:00+00:00", "duration": 11}], "description": "To help run a range of educational courses providing disadvantaged young people with an opportunity to rebuild their lives.", "awardDate": "2016-11-07T00:00:00+00:00", "amountAppliedFor": 9213, "amountAwarded": 7500, "fundingOrganization": [{"name": "Essex Community Foundation", "id_and_name": "[\"Essex Community Foundation\", \"GB-CHC-1052061\"]", "id": "GB-CHC-1052061"}], "currency": "GBP", "title": "Braintree Discovery College", "Primary beneficiary": "Children and Young People", "Primary ethnicity": "British", "Primary issue": "Education and Training", "grantProgramme": [{"title": "Wilkinson Family Fund", "code": "2016/17"}], "id": "360G-EssexCF-A395244"}
, {"recipientOrganization": [{"charityNumber": "1136245", "companyNumber": "06972805", "description": "To relieve the social, emotional, physical and educational needs of carers and their families living in the Rochford District. This is achieved through a range of group sessions, individual interventions and awareness raising/training; including respite groups, a schools based one to one programme available to all schools in the district, online support forums, advocacy and information services, training for staff and volunteers working with young people, carers and their families across the district. SCAFT works with young carers aged 6-18 years, and is continuing to see much growth in referrals relating to 6-8year olds over the past year. Support is offered through separate primary and secondary aged respite group sessions, run at two venues across the district to aid ease of access. Each group runs fortnightly giving a total of 8 groups a month. The groups offer respite from their caring responsibilities, a chance to meet and share with others in a similar situation, staff and peer support, art and other creative activities, games and sports and a range of informal and formal learning opportunities. The one to one schools service has continued to grow since being expanded to include primary schools 18 months ago and we have recently increased our staffing to boost capacity in this service. This service gives vital support to young carers unable to access the group evenings due to their caring commitments and is able to provide advocacy to young people struggling to balance their education with the demands of caring on issues such as lateness or absence, late or missed homework, or peer relationships and bullying. SCAFT has now become an accredited ADSAN learning provider in order to increase the range of learning opportunities available to young carers. We are integrating the ASDAN \u2018Stepping Stones\u2019 programme into our primary sessions, aimed at bolstering our younger users learning and social skills to improve their ability to make use of other educational opportunities such as school. The secondary groups will be undertaking a range of more targeted short courses, the first of which is a peer mentoring project to develop our users ability to support each other, with new skills and techniques. We hope that this programme will led to the establishment of Peer based Young Carers Ambassadors in each secondary school to act as a point of first contact for young people finding themselves in a caring role. SCAFT provides adult carers with respite groups, advice and information, counselling and advocacy services, working to reduce social isolation and improve wellbeing. SCAFT is also now looking to establish a support service for parents of children who are carers as a recent pilot project in the north of the county by Action for Family Carers showed a real need for this type of support. We are undertaking a consultation with families to establish the level of need locally and what shape this support should take. We expect this service to utilize our Young Carers Support Workers to work with parents to better support their child, as well as our Adult Carer Support Worker to provide direct support to the parent, such as benefit advice and counselling.

HIV infection commonly causes growth failure, with impaired linear growth (stunting) affecting up to 50% of children; pubertal onset may be delayed by up to a year. Linear growth is dependent upon skeletal development much of which occurs during puberty. The majority of lifetime bone mass is accrued during puberty until linear growth ceases at the end of puberty and peak bone mass (PBM) is reached. We hypothesize that HIV-infected children will have lower bone mass due to growth disruption. This has important implications as PBM accounts for 60% of lifetime osteoporosis risk: a 10% decrease in PBM doubles adulthood fracture risk. Therefore optimising PBM is critical for future fracture prevention.\n\n \n\nI aim to investigate the impact of HIV on bone mass in peri-pubertal children (8-16 years) established on ART in Zimbabwe. I will recruit 300 HIV-infected and 300 HIV-uninfected children into a prospective cohort study and perform musculoskeletal assessments at baseline and at one year to determine skeletal changes by HIV status.

We will draw from compositional  approaches and aesthetic impulses that plunder experimental music, fringe theatre & performance, digital interactivity,  and design-led immersive performance to celebrate vocal individuality and daring, and thereby expand the boundaries of vocal art for children. The project has three strands. One develops an iPad app, 'Voice Bubbles', whose vibrant and sensual visual design and sonic content will draw child and family users into interactive vocal creavity, allowing them to record, 'paint' with, organise, play back, and discover improvisatory delight in their body's extended vocal sound. The second is a pe rformerless installation, 'Voice Trunk', whose layered, cork-bark exterior will open into a sound-light-and-texture wonderworld, inside which audience are enticed into extending and creatively manipulating their audiovisual worlds using vocal play as source material. Alongside the above, we wish to refine and improve the content, design, and audience engagement strategies for the original piece, 'Uluzuzulalia', and expand its reach via a national tour. These outcomes, supported by the pr oject web site, will create and disseminate an original suite of interactive works which stimulate reflection on the human vocal body's nature, and its relationship with sensation and emotion, celebrating our vocal anatomies' unique, creative individualities.", "dataset": {"datagetter_metadata": {"datetime_downloaded": "2018-07-05T10:59:03+00:00", "json": "data/json_all/a001p00000xQ047AAC.json", "file_type": "xlsx", "downloads": true, "acceptable_license": true, "valid": true}, "description": "", "title": "Grants awarded from 1 October 2005 to 30 September 2017", "license": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "publisher": {"website": "https://wellcome.ac.uk", "prefix": "360G-wellcome", "logo": "https://www.threesixtygiving.org/wp-content/uploads/wellcome-logo-black.png", "name": "Wellcome Trust"}, "issued": "2018-03-21", "funders": [["The Wellcome Trust", "GB-CHC-210183"]], "license_name": "Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)", "modified": "2018-03-27T07:02:32+0000", "distribution": [{"title": "Grants awarded from 1 October 2005 to 30 September 2017", "accessURL": "https://wellcome.ac.uk/funding/managing-grant/grants-awarded", "downloadURL": "https://wellcome.ac.uk/sites/default/files/wellcome-grants-awarded-2005-2017_0.xlsx"}], "identifier": "a001p00000xQ047AAC"}, "plannedDates": [{"startDate": "2013-08-01T00:00:00+00:00", "endDate": "2015-07-31T00:00:00+00:00"}], "awardDate": "2013-06-26T00:00:00+00:00", "amountAwarded": 116818, "fundingOrganization": [{"name": "The Wellcome Trust", "id_and_name": "[\"The Wellcome Trust\", \"GB-CHC-210183\"]", "id": "GB-CHC-210183"}], "Region": "South East", "Approval Committee": "Arts Awards Funding Committee", "currency": "GBP", "title": "Extending the Vivacious Voice: Uluzuzulalia, Voice Bubbles and the Voice Trunk.", "Financial Year": "2012/13", "filename": "a001p00000xQ047AAC.json", "Lead Applicant": "Prof Yvon Bonenfant", "grantProgramme": [{"title": "Large Arts Award"}], "id": "360G-Wellcome-102007_Z_13_Z"}

Rather than treating this issue reactively, and dealing with the consequences of an accident, Lifeskills takes a proactive approach to accident prevention. Our aim is not to wrap people in cotton wool but to give them the skills and confidence to do more, without putting themselves or others at risk. Lifeskills is an amazing, interactive village, complete with a road, shops and houses, where visitors learn vital skills by actually experiencing difficult situations. This may range from crossing a busy road to discovering a house fire and calling 999. Having the opportunity to experience difficult situations, make choices and learn from mistakes is an incredibly effective and memorable way to learn. Programmes target those most at risk of injury, primarily school children, people with learning difficulties, older people and pre-school children.

The YMCA has at its heart the desire to attract and support all young people sharing values and friendship and supporting them to achieve a sense of belonging in their community through making a positive contribution. The organisation and building has existed on its current site for over 40 years but was formed originally in Taunton in 1855. Over this period it has continued to provide services for young people developing links and partnerships beneficial to this work. Currently it runs substantial youth provision during term time and holiday activities for 7 - 19 years. We also work with young people who are 'looked after' in foster care and those who are working with other informal education providers as well as those attending in small groups from local colleges. We have a very successful Pre-school which has been supporting families and young children for over 40 years. We offer and welcome other users of all ages from the local community access to our services and facilities including sports facilities. We have a variety of family activities e.g. karate, judo, dance, kick fit and kick boxing and an excellent all weather 5-a-side football pitch which is used by local adult teams, Saturday youth football and our weekly walking football.

, {"recipientOrganization": [{"name": "Sea Mills Together", "description": "Sea Mills Together is a community group which was formed by resident and local people who live and work in Sea Mills and Coombe Dingle. Our Vision: We want to affect positive change for the whole community of Sea Mills and Coombe Dingle. We also aim for Sea Mills to be a strong cohesive community. Our environment being green and with comfortable homes. Our Neighbourhoods being safe to live in. Residents of all ages having quality activity areas and play space for all. Having good well managed community facilities which are open to all We hope that we will be able to make a difference to people in our community and will work hard to ensure everyone in Sea Mills and Coombe Dingle have the opportunity to give their opinion and ideas to us, so that we can act on them. SMT was originally set up by a small group of residents who worked to deliver some specific projects, such as the creation of a Community Map which was designed with help of local school children and was opened by the Lord Mayor on Sea Mills Sqr (http://www.tcvoice.co.uk/img/sea-mills-map-unveiled-sea-mills-primary.jpg). In the process of creating its next project, a new circular bench on Sea Mills Sqr around the famous and original Addision Oak the Chair and Vice Chair were forced by personal and health reasons to stand down and the organisation became dormant as they stepped back. A new group of residents has worked hard to revitalize SMT in response to the electoral boundary changes which divided Sea Mills into two separate wards. We\u2019ve held a series of events, attended by dozens of local people, which have strongly endorsed the creation of a Community Plan as a vital way forward to hold onto and strengthen the identity and cohesion of the neighborhood. The Community Plan is now our priority project, and we wish to build and maintain this local support, by hosting meetings to ensure that it is the residents and local people who shape the early stages, by all feeding into the design of the survey. Through this we have demonstrated support for the active phase of the project. The Plan will form the basis for more local initiatives and will provide a mandate from the local people to achieve these initiatives. The data the plan creates will help provide an evidence base to apply for funding. We have been delighted with the response to our publicity for the public events we have held, where we used the The Community Voice Newsletter to inform people of our meetings. The Community Voice Newsletter is the mechanism with which we plan to distribute the surveys and therefore we have already tested this as a successful way of reaching and engaging people, particularly those who have not previously attended any local community functions (such as BCC Forums etc). We\u2019ve reached out for advice from our neighboring areas in North Bristol (Lawrence Weston, Henbury and Brentry and Southmead) which are areas which have used Community Planning processes to achieve improvements in their communities. This has helped in setting our proposed direction. We can learn from their models and hard won lessons and successful template to ensure we achieve our aims, and make our plan our own. Our group has already decided that were going to step into the gap left by the roll back of the NP events and create a new, dynamic, resident led way of shaping our community in similar open public meetings.", "id_and_name": "[\"Sea Mills Together\", \"360G-QuartetCF-ACC848850\"]", "url": "http://seamillstogether.org.uk/", "id": "360G-QuartetCF-ACC848850"}], "filename": "a001p00000y1HcQAAU.json", "Primary age group": "All Ages", "beneficiaryLocation": [{"geoCode": "E01014642", "name": "Bristol 007B", "geoCodeType": "LSOA", "countryCode": "GB"}], "dataset": {"datagetter_metadata": {"datetime_downloaded": "2018-07-05T10:56:16+00:00", "json": "data/json_all/a001p00000y1HcQAAU.json", "file_type": "xlsx", "downloads": true, "acceptable_license": true, "valid": true}, "description": "", "title": "Quartet Community Foundation grants awarded April 2017 to March 2018", "license": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "publisher": {"website": "http://quartetcf.org.uk/", "prefix": "360G-QuartetCF", "logo": "http://www.threesixtygiving.org/wp-content/uploads/Quartet-logo_standard-high-res.jpg", "name": "Quartet Community Foundation"}, "issued": "2018-04-11", "funders": [["Quartet Community Foundation", "GB-CHC-1080418"]], "license_name": "Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)", "modified": "2018-04-11T14:08:31+0000", "distribution": [{"title": "Quartet Community Foundation grants awarded April 2017 to March 2018", "accessURL": "http://quartetcf.org.uk/report/grants-awarded/", "downloadURL": "http://quartetcf.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Grants-Awarded-2017-18-360Giving-data-standard-2.xlsx"}], "identifier": "a001p00000y1HcQAAU"}, "dateModified": "2018-02-28T00:00:00+00:00", "plannedDates": [{"startDate": "2017-10-19T00:00:00+00:00", "endDate": "2019-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "duration": 15}], "description": "To put together the Sea Mills and Coombe Dingle Community Plan to set out a vision for the area.", "awardDate": "2018-02-06T00:00:00+00:00", "Impact Category": "Maximise ability to strengthen community cohesion and build social capacity", "amountAppliedFor": 2000, "amountAwarded": 2000, "fundingOrganization": [{"name": "Quartet Community Foundation", "id_and_name": "[\"Quartet Community Foundation\", \"GB-CHC-1080418\"]", "id": "GB-CHC-1080418"}], "currency": "GBP", "title": "Sea Mills & Coombe Dingle Community Plan", "Primary beneficiary": "Local residents", "Primary ethnicity": "All Ethnicities", "Primary issue": "Stronger communities/Community support and development", "grantProgramme": [{"title": "Community Planning", "code": "ComPlan 2017-18"}], "id": "360G-QuartetCF-A467012"}

Our project manager is an Activate tutor. Through Activate people begin to find their voice and have the confidence to speak out and challenge unjust decisions, and know how to understand power and approach authority.

Insecticide treated bednets and new powerful antimalarial drugs have led to a reduction in the number of malaria deaths. However malaria control remains poor in many areas, and if we are to eliminate and eventually eradicate the disease from the world we will require the use of all the tools at our disposal.One potentially very valuable tool, currently underused, is the antimalarial drug primaquine, which is uniquely able to kill the mature male and female sexual forms of the malaria parasite. Research has shown that primaquine greatly reduces the malaria offspring in the mosquito and thus effectively reduces transmission of the disease. So, primaquine looks to be a good 'transmission blocker' and, if used widely in patients, may reduce malaria transmission and contribute to the elimination of malaria in a community.Unfortunately primaquine has one major disadvantage. It can damage the red blood cells and cause anaemia in individuals who carry a very common genetic abnormality deficiency of an enzyme called glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, G6PD for short. This deficiency is much more common in men because of the way it is inherited. This is called haemolysis. This is a real downside of primaquine, though this problem has mainly been seen when primaquine is given in high doses for many days. However, for its 'transmission blocking' effects on the malaria parasite only a single, low dose of primaquine is thought to be required. This is considered by most experts to be too little primaquine to cause a major problem with haemolysis. Despite this many malaria control programmes are unwilling to use primaquine because they consider it too dangerous. You can test for G6PD deficiency but this requires test kits and staff to administer them. Many countries cannot afford to test millions of malaria patients before giving primaquine. In 2012 the World Health Organization (WHO) concluded on the basis of the available evidence and expert opinion that single low dose primaquine was safe to use even in malaria patients with G6PD deficiency. However the WHO also called for more research.Four years later virtually no one is using low dose primaquine because that research has not been done. If we can show beyond doubt that low dose primaquine is safe in G6PD deficient children with malaria, malaria programmes would feel much happier giving it and we could then go to the drug companies and ask them to make primaquine that is suitable for children.To see if single low dose primaquine is as safe as experts think we plan to study over 1,500 children with malaria attending outpatients in two hospitals in Uganda and one in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Using a simple test for G6PD deficiency we will find 750 children with malaria who have G6PD deficiency, and 750 who have normal G6PD levels. Within these two groups we will, on a random basis, give half of the patients normal antimalarial treatment and the other half normal antimalarial treatment PLUS single low dose primaquine. We will then watch the children very carefully to see whether giving primaquine causes more anaemia than not giving primaquine, and whether this occurs particularly in the G6PD deficient group. We need to have comparison groups of children who do not receive primaquine and some children who do not have G6PD deficiency as malaria itself causes haemolysis, as can G6PD deficiency in some circumstances even without primaquine treat. Our aim is to unpick the effects of G6PD deficiency, malaria, and primaquine administration to really be sure whether in all circumstances giving low dose primaquine is safe.If this research shows that giving single low dose primaquine is safe, this will enable WHO and national governments to recommend safe treatment regimens that will both cure the patient and also prevent transmission of malaria to other children.", "dataset": {"datagetter_metadata": {"datetime_downloaded": "2018-07-05T10:59:03+00:00", "json": "data/json_all/a001p00000xQ047AAC.json", "file_type": "xlsx", "downloads": true, "acceptable_license": true, "valid": true}, "description": "", "title": "Grants awarded from 1 October 2005 to 30 September 2017", "license": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "publisher": {"website": "https://wellcome.ac.uk", "prefix": "360G-wellcome", "logo": "https://www.threesixtygiving.org/wp-content/uploads/wellcome-logo-black.png", "name": "Wellcome Trust"}, "issued": "2018-03-21", "funders": [["The Wellcome Trust", "GB-CHC-210183"]], "license_name": "Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)", "modified": "2018-03-27T07:02:32+0000", "distribution": [{"title": "Grants awarded from 1 October 2005 to 30 September 2017", "accessURL": "https://wellcome.ac.uk/funding/managing-grant/grants-awarded", "downloadURL": "https://wellcome.ac.uk/sites/default/files/wellcome-grants-awarded-2005-2017_0.xlsx"}], "identifier": "a001p00000xQ047AAC"}, "plannedDates": [{"startDate": "2016-09-01T00:00:00+00:00", "endDate": "2019-02-28T00:00:00+00:00"}], "awardDate": "2016-05-02T00:00:00+00:00", "amountAwarded": 363765, "fundingOrganization": [{"name": "The Wellcome Trust", "id_and_name": "[\"The Wellcome Trust\", \"GB-CHC-210183\"]", "id": "GB-CHC-210183"}], "Region": "South East", "Approval Committee": "Joint Global Health Trials Committee", "currency": "GBP", "title": "Assessing the safety of low dose primaquine in Plasmodium falciparum infected African children with glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency", "Financial Year": "2015/16", "filename": "a001p00000xQ047AAC.json", "Lead Applicant": "Prof Nicholas Day", "grantProgramme": [{"title": "Global Health Trials Award"}], "id": "360G-Wellcome-206008_Z_16_Z"}

The burden is heaviest in sub-Saharan Africa, where an estimated 90% of all malaria deaths occur, and in children aged under 5 years, who account for 78% of all deaths. [WHO 2014]. The high level of diversity of malaria parasites in the African continent contravenes elimination strategies and sustains the high burden of the disease in Africa. Knowledge of the genome wide diversity of the parasite, gene flow and adaptive processes are required to develop and refine elimination strategies. Indeed, the confirmation of Plasmodium falciparum artemisinin resistance in South-East Asia calls for pre-emptive surveillance of African parasite populations for genetic markers of emerging drug resistance. Because of unprecedented technological advances, there is a sharp increase in the production of genetic data from a range of pathogens including malaria parasites. Yet, very little of these thousands of terabites of sequence data has been translated into knowledge relevant for malaria control. This is mainly due to the fact that there is a \"strong wall\" between the malaria control community and the geneticists, indeed the two groups hardly understandeach other's languages. We propose to \"tear down this wall\". Indeed the translation of these genetic sequences into knowledge requires cutting edge skills that are currently lacking in sub-Saharan Africa. Yet, genetics is increasingly required for decision making in major public health threats such as HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, Malaria and other tropical diseases. To address this gap, a couple of years ago we established an African-led consortium, the African Plasmodium Diversity Network (PDNA) [Ghansah et al. Science]. PDNA includes Research and Academic Institutions from fifteen countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Through this DELTAS Africa proposal, which is driven by the PDNA leaders, will primarily focus on bridging the gap between public health community and geneticist through effectively engaging health workers and communities to interact with relevant genetic information. The main aims of this training programme will be to (1)Train, retain and develop graduates,doctoral and Postdoctoral fellows on genomics and bioinformatics across malaria endemic countries and (2) Develop programs to enhance the understanding and dissemination of genetic data relevant to malaria interventions and eradication programmes. Short-term training will be delivered for PDNA fellows including public health officers on genetics, clinical studies, ethics, grant writing, grant management and student supervision. Formal long-term curricula (big data science, biostatistics, health informatics, genomics, cell biology, molecular biology and bioinformatics) will be designed and implemented with contribution and oversight from a wide range of local and International Faculty and relevant advisory boards. Trainees already familiar with or actively involved in disease control will be targeted for recruitment. Customized career development and mentorship of targeted scientists will reveal and nurture new leaders in these specific fields.We will increasing the number of skilled Africans capable of leading the field and fulling exploiting genetics for the improvement of health in Africa.", "dataset": {"datagetter_metadata": {"datetime_downloaded": "2018-07-05T10:59:03+00:00", "json": "data/json_all/a001p00000xQ047AAC.json", "file_type": "xlsx", "downloads": true, "acceptable_license": true, "valid": true}, "description": "", "title": "Grants awarded from 1 October 2005 to 30 September 2017", "license": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "publisher": {"website": "https://wellcome.ac.uk", "prefix": "360G-wellcome", "logo": "https://www.threesixtygiving.org/wp-content/uploads/wellcome-logo-black.png", "name": "Wellcome Trust"}, "issued": "2018-03-21", "funders": [["The Wellcome Trust", "GB-CHC-210183"]], "license_name": "Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)", "modified": "2018-03-27T07:02:32+0000", "distribution": [{"title": "Grants awarded from 1 October 2005 to 30 September 2017", "accessURL": "https://wellcome.ac.uk/funding/managing-grant/grants-awarded", "downloadURL": "https://wellcome.ac.uk/sites/default/files/wellcome-grants-awarded-2005-2017_0.xlsx"}], "identifier": "a001p00000xQ047AAC"}, "Applicant Surname": "Djimde", "awardDate": "2015-05-05T00:00:00+00:00", "amountAwarded": 905541, "Lead Applicant": "Dr Abdoulaye Djimde", "fundingOrganization": [{"name": "The Wellcome Trust", "id_and_name": "[\"The Wellcome Trust\", \"GB-CHC-210183\"]", "id": "GB-CHC-210183"}], "Region": "International", "Approval Committee": "DELTAs Africa Interview Committee", "currency": "GBP", "title": "Developing Excellence in Leadership and Genetic Training for Malaria Elimination in Sub-Saharan Africa (DELGEME)", "Financial Year": "2014/15", "filename": "a001p00000xQ047AAC.json", "plannedDates": [{"startDate": "2016-02-01T00:00:00+00:00", "endDate": "2021-01-31T00:00:00+00:00"}], "grantProgramme": [{"title": "DELTAS Initiative"}], "id": "360G-Wellcome-107740_Z_15_Z"}

Carnival of the Brain will transform a section of City Art Centre into a journey through the brain,  themed around a retro carnival setting. Audiences will step through a visually exciting entrance to the gateway of the mind, and follow carnival-style signposts that direct them to drop-in workshop activities that use traditional carnival activities to explore areas of the brain: e.g. the Frontal Lobe, Occipital Lobe, Peripheral Nervous System, Brainstem and the Big Brain Top. These will run alongside other activities, such as wall-based illusions and communicator-led challenges and puzzles.  Set in a traditional fairground environment, this workshop will have a distinctive and playful atmosphere that appeals to audiences of all ages. We will use creative props, lighting and set-dressing to stage an immersive environment that provides a fresh approach to hands-on science.

This applicatio n seeks to develop and broaden these collaborations in connection with some of the seminal theories emerging from the Brazier project, focusing on the themes of autonomy, compromise and improving the doctor/patient therapeutic partnership. A number of issues related to the themes of autonomy, compromise and the therapeutic partnership will form the foci of the event: (i) Ethico-legal dilemmas and the frontiers of science: a) Reproduction and the beginning of life; b) Organs and human t issue; and, c) Identifying future research goals linked to reproduction and organs and human tissue.

For 18 years we have provided intensive therapeutic support to parents and their babies from conception to two years old as well as training and consultation for practitioners and professionals. OXPIP also works with policy makers and the general public to build awareness, support and capacity for parent infant attachment and infant mental health. Our aim is to redress disadvantage and deprivation that adversely affect development at the start of a child's life. A substantial body of neuro scientific evidence supports OXPIP's work, indicating that the origins of many social and mental health problems lie in infancy and childhood, and are strongly influenced by the quality of the parent infant relationship. Children lacking experience of loving relationships and strong attachments in the first two years of life are more likely to struggle to establish secure or happy relationships as they grow. Inconsistent and neglectful or abusive care in infancy is known to impact directly on brain development, affecting the individual's ability to regulate emotions properly. We have worked in Oxfordshire for 18 years and started a small project in Reading two years ago. We work in six Childrens' centres in Oxfordshire (funding sadly ending in December 2016 due to recent cuts).

The device will use these responses to interactively adapt the test for that particular patient, customising it for each individual. The device will monitor patients while they do the test and automatically correct for any changes in viewing distance. As a result, it will provide clinicians with more accurate data on 3D vision, especially in small children. This will help healthcare professionals to track the progress of treatment and make the best clinical decisions.", "dataset": {"datagetter_metadata": {"datetime_downloaded": "2018-07-05T10:59:03+00:00", "json": "data/json_all/a001p00000xQ047AAC.json", "file_type": "xlsx", "downloads": true, "acceptable_license": true, "valid": true}, "description": "", "title": "Grants awarded from 1 October 2005 to 30 September 2017", "license": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "publisher": {"website": "https://wellcome.ac.uk", "prefix": "360G-wellcome", "logo": "https://www.threesixtygiving.org/wp-content/uploads/wellcome-logo-black.png", "name": "Wellcome Trust"}, "issued": "2018-03-21", "funders": [["The Wellcome Trust", "GB-CHC-210183"]], "license_name": "Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)", "modified": "2018-03-27T07:02:32+0000", "distribution": [{"title": "Grants awarded from 1 October 2005 to 30 September 2017", "accessURL": "https://wellcome.ac.uk/funding/managing-grant/grants-awarded", "downloadURL": "https://wellcome.ac.uk/sites/default/files/wellcome-grants-awarded-2005-2017_0.xlsx"}], "identifier": "a001p00000xQ047AAC"}, "Applicant Surname": "Read", "awardDate": "2013-11-28T00:00:00+00:00", "amountAwarded": 368397, "Lead Applicant": "Prof Jennifer Read", "fundingOrganization": [{"name": "The Wellcome Trust", "id_and_name": "[\"The Wellcome Trust\", \"GB-CHC-210183\"]", "id": "GB-CHC-210183"}], "Region": "North East", "Approval Committee": "Health Innovation Challenge Fund", "currency": "GBP", "title": "Accurate and patient-friendly measurement of binocular visual function using a 3D smartphone", "Financial Year": "2013/14", "filename": "a001p00000xQ047AAC.json", "plannedDates": [{"startDate": "2014-12-01T00:00:00+00:00", "endDate": "2018-02-28T00:00:00+00:00"}], "grantProgramme": [{"title": "Health Innovation Challenge Fund Award"}], "id": "360G-Wellcome-102565_Z_13_Z"}

One develops an iPad app, 'Voice Bubbles', whose vibrant and sensual visual design and sonic content will draw child and family users into interactive vocal creavity, allowing them to record, 'paint' with, organise, play back, and discover improvisatory delight in their body's extended vocal sound. The second is a pe rformerless installation, 'Voice Trunk', whose layered, cork-bark exterior will open into a sound-light-and-texture wonderworld, inside which audience are enticed into extending and creatively manipulating their audiovisual worlds using vocal play as source material.

In 2009, Yellow Submarine partnered with two day centres and a local authority and four holidays with 19 PWLD (and their carers who gained respite) benefitting. The trips that have taken place so far have been very popular and successful both with the \u2018service users\u2019, their carers and the volunteers who helped. Video feedback can be viewed on our site, with carers saying the holidays have helped increase confidence, create new friendships, and give a welcome break! Yellow Submarine believes people with learning disabilities deserve to live life to the full. We are a small award-winning charity which prides itself on giving some of the most disadvantaged people in Oxfordshire confidence, independence and a sense of self-worth. For children (aged 11-18) living in Oxfordshire we run an extensive programme in the school holidays.

All parents and carers will, from time to time, encounter problems which make the task harder. The key to success is for parents and carers to be strong and resilient, so they can meet challenges head on, and navigate their way through or around them successfully. Through mobilising hundreds of volunteers, we support families to help themselves, developing parenting skills and improving connections in their community.

It is currently estimated that over the course of one year, the value of HSE volunteer time will be over \u00a372,000 (ONS figures https://goo.gl/Uwz2cz).

Families frequently tell us the impact of a volunteer, giving their time freely, can be far more meaningful than a paid statutory professional. Isolation and mental health issues remain the top two concerns for most of the families we support, and this often means their ability to access mainstream services is limited.

As an existing provider of peri/postnatal services in Harlow, and with a strong history of peer/ volunteer led practice, HSE are ideally positioned to lead on the project; building on our expertise and ability to engage families; ensuring that their voice is not only heard, but responded to in practical, real terms. HSE are confident that the project is deliverable as commitment has been tested with partners (e.g. Virgin/Banardo\u2019s and University of Essex (UofE)) who say objectives are both realistic and achievable. By drawing on our existing network of partners, and engagement with families, HSE are keen to shape the future of family led practice.

, {"recipientOrganization": [{"name": "Lads Need Dads CIC", "description": "Who we are: Lads Need Dads CIC is a Not-For-Profit Community Interest Company, based in Tendring, North East Essex, set up to prevent potential problems and address existing ones where boys are missing a father figure in their lives. Our Mission: To empower and enable boys aged 11-15 with absent fathers or limited access to a male role model, to be motivated, responsible, capable, resilient and emotionally competent to prevent them from coming at risk of under achieving, offending, exclusion or dropping out of school. What we do: \u2022 Help boys through male-led group mentoring, to cope with problems and issues faced at home and school, and explore the important choices they face in their adolescent development, to prevent escalation of negative behaviour. \u2022 Provide boys with opportunities for adventure, to be tested and challenged, both physically and mentally. \u2022 Provide boys with practical life-skill training, community volunteering and peer mentoring opportunities. \u2022 Raise awareness and understanding of the important role fathers play in the emotional, mental and educational development and well-being of boys. Why we do it: In 2013 the Centre for Social Justice published Fractured Families: Why stability matters, which highlighted an alarming trend of fatherlessness across the UK. It found that a teenager sitting their GCSEs is more likely to own a smartphone than live with their father, (only 57 per cent of 15-year olds are still living with their fathers while 62 per cent own a smartphone), (1). Nationally almost one quarter of families with dependent children are lone-parent families. (2) This figure rises significantly in our poorest neighbourhoods, and can be as high as 75 percent. (3) Blanden (2006) (4), found a father\u2019s low interest in his son\u2019s education, for instance, reduces his boy\u2019s chances of escaping poverty by 25% and at the more extreme end, 76% of all male prisoners in England and Wales had an absent father. Statistically males are the more vulnerable gender when it comes to alcohol and drug misuse, victims of murder, victims of suicide, homelessness. Lads Need Dads was set up to provide a preventative and early-intervention response to an ever-increasing social issue. Our services: \u2018EQUIP\u2019, is a six-month self-development group-work programme held in school including bush-craft and outdoor activities supported by a facilitator and a team of male mentors. Equips\u2019 aim is to help boys cope with problems and issues faced at home and school, and explore the important choices they face in their adolescent development, to prevent escalation of negative behaviour. Engage, a practical life-skill and community volunteering programme follows Equip and takes place in the community for six-months and involves boys attending practical life-skill workshops and together with thier mentors, doing voluntary work for lone parents, pensioners and people with a disability within their local community. Jobs include, DIY, painting and decorating, gardening, shed building, etc. Inspire, a peer mentoring programme incorporating inspirational speakers and visits to inspiring places, completes the 18-month programme. We have run the 18-month pilot once through between March 2016 and August 2017 with excellent outcomes. We started another Equip Programme in May this year. This ended this month (Nov) and the boys off this programme are now attending Engage, the second part of the programme. Alongside the programme we provide on-going support for mums and carers via workshops, coffee mornings and a face-book support group. We raise awareness within the community by giving talks and presentations to community groups, attending public events etc. We run an open-ended check-in group for graduates of the programme one evening a month to keep the arm of support in place, should they need it. We run a fishing club in the summer which is open to any boy on the programme, graduate or new boy who fits our criteria. We are just about to start a guitar club for boys who want to learn to play the guitar but who can't afford lessons. All our services are provided free of charge. We have a growing team of 14 male volunteer male mentors, between the ages of 29 and 70, from a wide range of backgrounds and from the local community. Our Director board is made up of four professionals from education, social care, statutory services and the voluntary sector. We are just entering into our next round of recruitment so anticipate our volunteer numbers increasing.

Universal services are provided such as open access youth work sessions, as well as more targeted group work on specific issues such as sexual health and relationships, substance misuse, nutrition, self esteem and confidence, identity, protective behaviours and staying safe. The organisation is committed to a co-design model with service users having a voice in the focus of the targeted support. Young people engaged with the service are passionate about what they want to change and what issues they face on a daily basis within their community. We are working towards the establishment of a youth forum who will help the organisation shape its service delivery focus into the areas that cause the next generation of such a deprived community the most concern. We are interested in providing a safe space where, such an often unheard sector of the community, has a voice, where they are heard and are empowered to become part of the solution to the issues they face. Aptitude operates out of a community centre in Radford and draws in young people from Central North-East wards of Coventry, many of which are deprived as being in the top 10% of the most nationally deprived lower layer super output areas.

Our five core strategic objectives are: building a cohesive community; achieving improvements in people\u2019s lives; stewarding the Farm\u2019s resources; increasing skills and knowledge; connecting people to the natural world. We do this by delivering 15 different projects that fall within one of two pivotal Farm themes: 1) 'Roots to Health' - which aims to increase the health and wellbeing of adults with complex health needs; 2) 'Branching Out' - which aims to increase the health and wellbeing of children and young people, particularly those that are disadvantaged. Through these projects we encourage people to maximise their capabilities and gain the resilience and confidence to have control over their lives. We do this by providing fulfulling volunteering opportunties, supporting education, training and hands-on learning in gardening, animal care, cookery and land management and running therapeutic projects in a range of creative activities.

Our Drop-in\u2019s provide 1-1 sessions with a Support Worker allowing a young person to explore their difficulties and feelings, in a safe environment. Through these sessions we help them to improve their communication with peers, families and agencies so they are more resilient. By learning skills that will help them to problem solve their issues in the future more positively. By identifying their qualities, we progress onto a range of youth led group activities, this helps them to hone in on their often, hidden talents.

The funding will enable weekly workshops to take place during the school holidays for a year - including ingredients, professional tutors, recipes, educational materials, training workshops for parents and the purchase of cooking equipment to enable the project to become self-sufficient and parent-led after the 12 month period, leaving a lasting legacy and commitment towards healthy lifestyles.", "recipientLocation": "E05008668 Ellesmere Port Town Ward E06000050 North West Cheshire West and Chester", "recipientDistrictName": "Cheshire West and Chester", "fundingOrganization": [{"name": "Cheshire Community Foundation", "id_and_name": "[\"Cheshire Community Foundation\", \"GB-CHC-1143711\"]", "id": "GB-CHC-1143711"}], "Round": {"Round Name": "2017 2 July"}, "currency": "GBP", "Grant Application": {"ID": "a061600000ma7V2"}, "grantProgramme": [{"title": "CCF - Main Grants Programme"}], "Grant Application No": "A447720"}
